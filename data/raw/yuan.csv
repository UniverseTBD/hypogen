Akshara Viswanathan,"Constraining the origins of the most primitive and metal-poor stars in our Milky Way allows us to time travel back to the earliest epoch of star formation and reconstruct the hierarchical assembly of our Galaxy. The highly metallicity sensitive Ca H&K doublet lines around 395 nm can be used to isolate these important but rare stars. The Pristine survey was designed using a narrow-band filter around this wavelength to estimate stellar metallicity for millions of FGK stars and efficiently find the lowest metallicity populations. Thanks to the low-resolution BP-RP spectra provided by Gaia DR3, it is now possible to mimic a Pristine narrow-band filter in these data and hunt for these rare and old stars. This gives us an all-sky distribution of the metal-poor Milky Way. Here I present the first spectroscopic follow-up efforts of this new catalogue of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo. Using this new dataset and technique, we find that 77% of the stars with photometric (Pristine model integrated over the Gaia spectra) [Fe/H] < −2.8 have a spectroscopic [Fe/H] < −2.5. These statistics are a huge improvement over the existing methods that search for extremely metal-poor stars. I will put these stars into the context of the halo and its substructures, by using a very pure sample of Gaia DR3 halo main sequence stars (selected using the reduced proper motion property) combined with metallicity from the deeper Pristine photometry. We can get reliable distances far and beyond what would be possible using reliable Gaia parallax for these stars. This allows us to study the anomalies in the metallicity structure across different distances, contributions of the kicked-up thick disk stars and map out the metal-poor Milky Way halo across various lines of sight. By expanding the number of spectroscopically studied metal-poor stars efficiently and uniformly and studying the metal-poor tail of the Galaxy, we get a better view of some of the most intricate parts of our Galaxy and complement the analysis of galactic assembly and star formation histories in the high-redshift universe.",Observational diagnostics of the old Milky Way using the most metal-poor stars
Anke Arentsen (1),"The oldest, most metal-poor stars in the Milky Way are unique probes of early star formation and the assembly of the Milky Way. The Galactic bulge region has typically been avoided in the search for metal-poor stars, because of the extremely high density of mostly metal-rich stars and the high dust extinction. The bulk of the Galactic bulge is thought to originate from the (early) Galactic disk. However, the oldest pressure-supported component in our Galaxy is also expected to be present in its innermost region. The most metal-poor stars in the bulge region can provide unique insights into the ancient Milky Way. I will present results from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS), which used metallicity-sensitive narrow-band CaHK photometry to identify metal-poor candidates in the bulge. PIGS is the largest spectroscopic survey of inner Galaxy metal-poor stars (~10 000 with [Fe/H] < -1.0) and very metal-poor stars (~2000 with [Fe/H] < -2.0) to date. Using the bulk PIGS radial velocities, we previously showed that the amount of inner Galaxy rotation decreases with decreasing metallicity. We have recently derived individual distances and orbits for the entire PIGS sample, which we use to study how much the metal-poor stars contribute to the disky bulge vs. to a pressure-supported component, and how this changes with metallicity. I will also highlight the behaviour of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in PIGS. It is exciting to see the growing amount of data on metal-poor stars in the inner regions of the Milky Way, thanks to various surveys, allowing us to set important constraints on the formation of the ancient inner Galaxy.",Dynamical properties of ancient stars in the inner Milky Way with PIGS 
Anke Arentsen (2),"In early surveys searching for very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.0), it was recognised that many of the most metal-poor stars had exceptionally strong carbon absorptions. These carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars were found to consist of two main classes: the CEMP-no stars are thought to have been born carbon-rich, reflecting the composition of the interstellar medium enriched by the first generations of stars, whereas the CEMP-s stars, which are also enhanced in s-process elements and are usually found to be in binary systems, are thought to be the result of mass-transfer from a former AGB companion. CEMP stars are a unique resource for Galactic archaeology because they probe the properties of the First Stars, early chemical evolution and binary interactions at very low metallicity. Spectroscopic surveys in recent years have uncovered large numbers of CEMP stars, allowing us to begin to study them as a population. There are some hints that the properties of CEMP populations vary between different Galactic environments (inner/outer halo, bulge, dwarf galaxies), which could point to differences in the early formation and chemical evolution of these environments. I will discuss what we know about the frequency of CEMP stars among very metal-poor stars, and what challenges there are in determining it and in comparing it for different samples. I will present recent work on the comparison of various low-resolution spectroscopic samples of very metal-poor stars in the giant regime, showing that there is still more work necessary to pin down to properties of the populations of CEMP stars throughout the Milky Way. ",On the frequency of carbon-enhanced very metal-poor stars
Federico Sestito,"The most metal-poor stars (MMPs) are rare objects located mainly in the Milky Way halo. It is assumed that they formed in the relative pristine Galaxy shortly after the Big Bang, and they belong to the earliest generations of stars. The search for the MMPs is therefore important to answer questions on the masses of the first stars, the universality of the IMF, and the assembly of the Galaxy both in terms of chemistry and dynamics. Gaia started a revolution providing exquisite astrometric data, which are crucial for Galactic archaeology studies. In synergy with high-resolution spectroscopic data, we can now dissect the Galaxy in a multi-dimensional space.  I will show a chemo-dynamical investigation of MMPs focusing on the Galactic bulge. Stars are selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy survey, which uses the Ca HK filter at CFHT/MegaCam to select the MMP candidate stars. The chemistry from high-resolution Gemini/GRACE observations suggests these are among the oldest stars and brought in during the very early Galactic assembly. The abundances of three stars are compatible with second generation globular clusters stars. This indicates the presence of ancient and disrupted globular clusters in the inner Galaxy. One star points to the feasibility of forming extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-3.0) structures in the early Universe, which are now dissolved. Another star with confined to the disk orbit seems to be accreted very early from a fossil dwarf galaxy, which was polluted by only one low-mass supernovae.

Henrique Reggiani,"The progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms responsible for the thermonuclear events classified as Type Ia supernovae are uncertain and difficult to constrain using traditional observations of Type Ia properties (e.g., light curves).  Even though we do not fully understand their progenitors, we rely on our knowledge of these events to model galactic chemical evolution, as thermonuclear explosions are the main site in which iron-peak elements are synthesized.  Understanding the underlying properties of thermonuclear explosions would allow us to, among others, better model galactic chemical evolution and understand the physics behind Type Ia supernovae. To better constraint Type Ia progenitors, the prolific producers of iron, we used theoretical nucleosynthetic yields to identify a set of elemental abundance ratios infrequently observed in metal-poor stars but shared across a range of Type Ia progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.  We label stars with this abundance signature ``iron-rich metal-poor'' stars (IRMP).  IRMP stars formed in environments dominated by Type Ia nucleosynthesis and their chemical pattern can be used to constrain both the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms responsible for Type Ia supernovae.  We identify three IRMP stars in the literature and homogeneously infer their elemental abundances. We find that they can be best explained by deflagration-to-detonation transitions in sub- or near-Chandrasekhar mass progenitors.  I will also show how the occurrence rates of IRMP stars in our Galaxy and beyond, to provide an extra constraint on their nature.",Iron-Rich Metal-Poor stars as Probes to the Properties of Thermonuclear Explosions
Madeline Lucey (1),"The oldest stars in our Galaxy contain crucial information about the Early Universe and the formation of the Milky Way. Cosmological simulations have predicted that the highest density of ancient stars is in the inner Galaxy. In this talk, I present new research into the chemo-dynamical properties of (metal-poor) inner Galaxy stars and discuss what we've learned about the early Milky Way.  It has also been suggested that carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars may be true Population II stars in that they were solely enriched by material from the first generation of stars. In this talk I'll also discuss what we've learned from the Galactic distribution and orbital properties of these stars and how that fits into our ideas of the early Universe and the Milky Way's formation.

Madeline Lucey (2),"The chemo-dynamics of the stellar populations in the Galactic Bulge inform and constrain the Milky Way's formation and evolution. The metal-poor population is particularly important in light of cosmological simulations, which predict that some of the oldest stars in the Galaxy now reside in its center. The metal-poor bulge appears to consist of multiple stellar populations that require chemo-dynamical analyses to disentangle. In this presentation, I will describe our detailed chemo-dynamical study of the metal-poor stars in the inner Galaxy, named The COMBS Survey which uses VLT/FLAMES spectra of ~350 metal-poor stars. I will discuss the results and the implications for early Milky Way formation and chemical evolution. In addition, I will preview results from an ongoing survey of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, which are thought to be solely enriched by the first generation of stars.",Using metal-poor stars in the inner Galaxy to uncover the ancient Milky Way
Norhasliza Yusof,"Massive and very massive stars have tremendous impact in the cosmic evolution. The nucleosynthesis both during their advanced stages and their final explosion likely contribute greatly to the overall enrichment of the Universe. Their extreme conditions lead also to very important radiative and mechanical feedback effects, from local to cosmic scale.   In order to determine their fate, it is important to determine what is the final masses, for example for low metallicities massive or very massive stars, it can retain huge core masses and this could bring the possibility as the candidate of PISNe progenitors.   Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are very luminous explosions of massive, low-metallicity stars. They can potentially be observed out to high redshifts due to their high explosion energies, thus providing a probe of the Universe prior to reionization.

Carrie Filion,"Many disk galaxies host galactic bars, which exert time-dependent, non-axisymmetric forces that could play a key role in re-arranging stars throughout the disk. The resultant torques are expected to create an azimuth angle-dependent signal in (e.g.) the median distance that stars have traveled to enter a given radial annulus. We analyze an N-body simulation to examine the changes in the radial locations of stars (‘radial mixing') that occur in a disk galaxy after a bar has formed. We find that angle-dependent trends are present at all radii we consider, and radius-dependent trends roughly divide the disk into three radial ‘zones'. These ‘zones’ are characterized by whether the angle-averaged mean distance that stars have traveled to enter a given radial annulus is positive, negative, or approximately zero. The angle- and radius-dependent trends that we present here should be generic results for galaxies that host evolving bars. We discuss recent observational evidence for angle-dependent metallicity variations in the Milky Way in the context of this analysis, and we investigate the extent to which similar observations could be used to provide information about the radial re-arrangement that occurred in the disk. Finally, we suggest avenues for future analyses that will be possible with the data from upcoming surveys performed with massively multiplexed spectrographs, such as the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph.",Bar-induced Angle and Radius-Dependent Trends in Disk Galaxies
Dante Minniti,"The ESO Public Survey ”VISTA Variables in the” Via Lactea (VVV) and its extension called ”VVV eXtended Survey” (VVVX) have been mapping the Milky Way bulge and the Southern mid-plane in the near-IR, with observations starting in year 2010 and ending in year 2022. We monitored >2x109 point sources in total, within an area of about 1700 sq deg. This area includes about 50 known globular clusters, and >1000 known open clusters, with many more clusters to be found. The final products of our survey are deep JHKs-band images, and catalogues of variable point sources, and of proper motions. I will summarize some results and final maps from the complete VVVX observations. Only <1% of the MW stars have been measured to date. One particular pervasive problem for Galactic (and some extragalactic) studies is how far can we see at different wavelengths in the presence of extinction. We have used different distance indicators to trace the extinction horizon along the Galactic plane. I will present the results of our study, critically discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the various distance indicators (RC giants, RR Lyrae, Cepheids, LPVs/Miras, star clusters), also using complementary information from Gaia DR3. These results will be contrasted with the expected observations from major ground-based facilities like the Vera Rubin Telescope, and space missions, like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Roman Space Telescope.",The Galactic Extinction Horizon with Present and Future Surveys
Hidenori Matsui,"We investigate the gas supply process from the several  kpc scale to the central  pc scale in a barred galaxy. For this purpose, we have performed high resolution simulations of gas in a barred galaxy potential by using the simulation code ""ASURA"". Here, we include a wide temperature range of radiative cooling, star formation in dense and cold gas, and gas heating by supernovae. We have found that a gas ring forms within the central 1 kpc region. Since the gas density in the ring is high enough, formation of gas clouds takes place. Some formed clouds deviate from the ring due to cloud-cloud interactions, since these clouds collide with the other clouds which still rotate in the ring and these collisions reduce a large part of their orbital angular momentum. As a result, a few clouds finally fall into the galactic center of 10 pc scale. The process contributes to the episodic  gas supply to the galactic center. We discuss condition of such gas supply and a possible role in mass growth of a supermassive black hole in a galactic center.

Iris Breda,"A tantalizing enigma in extragalactic astronomy concerns the chronology and driving mechanisms of the build-up of late-type galaxies (LTGs). The standard scenario envisages two formation routes, with classical bulges (CBs) assembling first in a quick quasi-monolithic episode followed by gradual disk assembly, and pseudo-bulges (PBs) forming over the Gyr-long secular evolution of LTGs. The expectation is, therefore, the segregation of present-day LTG bulges into two distinct groups. Here we analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of bulges and disks for 135 LTGs from the CALIFA survey covering the relevant range in LTG mass. In addition, their physical properties were contrasted with predictions from evolutionary synthesis models, adopting exponentially declining SFHs, with an e-folding time 0.1 < τ < 20 Gyr. Analysis of the SFHs of ~ half-million spaxels consistently reveals that the main properties of bulges and disks show a continuous distribution across total stellar mass. Moreover, the τ in high-mass LTGs radially increases, suggesting that these grow in an inside-out fashion, while lower-mass LTGs display roughly the same τ throughout their entire radial extent. Evolutionary synthesis predictions are consistent with observations. Finally, bulges and disks of higher mass LTGs exhibit shorter formation timescales as compared to their lower mass counterparts. Collectively, the obtained results evince a coherent and unified picture for the formation and evolution of LTGs, in which PBs and CBs denote extremities of a continuous sequence. This analysis is consistent with the framework where bulges are assembled with their parent disks by gradual inside-out growth, at a pace that is regulated by the depth of the galactic potential. In accordance is the utter absence of bimodal correlations, as expected if CBs and PBs were to emerge from two distinct formation routes.",On the genesis of spiral galaxies - Classical and pseudo bulges as extremities of a continuous sequence
Rachel Lee McClure,"Up to two thirds of disk galaxies in the local universe host a bar — structures that transport gas and angular momentum throughout their host galaxies. The orbital composition of the stars of the bar and associated features in such galaxies is not well constrained, especially the ubiquitous X feature associated with bars in disk galaxies. These X structures are seen in at least half of edge-on disk galaxies and can account for ~40% of the stellar disk mass. In this work we describe the novel origins of the transient and persistent resonant families that populate the X feature building on existing literature investigations. Our separation and tracking of individual stellar orbits in high resolution N-body simulations of barred galaxies allows us to identify the mechanisms populating the X feature and to better understand bars through cosmological time.

Sandeep Kumar Kataria,"In this work, we conduct a statistical study of black hole masses of barred and unbarred galaxies in IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological simulation suites. This work aims to understand the role of the bars in the growth of black hole masses. We have looked into 1191 barred galaxies and 2738 unbarred galaxies samples. We use an equal number of barred and unbarred galaxies with a similar distribution of various controlling parameters like total galaxy mass, halo mass and gas mass etc. for an unbiased study. The median peak value of black hole masses distribution for barred galaxies is higher than that of the unbarred one.  The higher mean accretion rate on the black hole averaged over large redshifts (approx. z~2 to 0) supports the higher mean black hole masses in barred galaxies. Further, we also test that these results are unaffected by other surrounding environmental processes like the neighboring gas density of hosts and merger histories which includes both minor and major mergers. Our results have potential implications for triggering AGN activities highly debated but not yet clear in previous numerical and observational studies. Further, we provide constraints on black hole statistics to be observed for 3 sigma detection of our results.

Sioree Ansar (1),"Dark matter (DM) halo properties are extensively studied in cosmological simulations but are very challenging to estimate from observations. The dark matter halo density profile of observed galaxies is modelled using multiple probes that trace the dark matter potential. However, the angular momentum distribution of the dark matter halos is still a subject of debate. In this study we demonstrate a method for estimating the halo spin and halo concentration of a low surface brightness (LSB), gas rich dwarf barred galaxy UGC 5288 by forward modelling disk properties- stellar and gas surface densities, disk scale length, HI rotation curve, bar length and bar ellipticity derived from observations. We combine semi analytical techniques, N-body/SPH and cosmological simulations to model the dark matter halo of UGC 5288 with both a cuspy Hernquist profile and a flat-core pseudo-isothermal profile. We find that the best match with observations is a pseudo-isothermal halo model with core radius rc = 0.23 kpc, a high halo spin λ= 0.08 at the virial radius. Our findings are consistent with previous core radius estimates of the halo density profile of UGC 5288, as well as the theoretically predicted high spins of dwarf LSB galaxies. We show that our model of halo spin distribution matches with that of similar mass analogues of UGC 5288 galaxies in the high resolution cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG-50. Additionally, we find that the inner halo spin in barred galaxies is different from the unbarred ones, and the halo spin shows weak correlations with bar properties.","Dark Matter halo spin of the dwarf galaxy UGC 5288: Insights from Observations, N-body and Cosmological Simulations."
Sioree Ansar (2),"Despite decades of research, the mechanism of bar formation in galaxies is still a subject of debate. From isolated galaxy simulations we have gained valuable insight to how bars form and evolve. However, bars in the Universe evolve in galaxies in highly complex environments with multiple satellite interactions, mergers, gas accretion events, star-formation and gas in-fall to the central supermassive blackhole (SMBH), while simultaneously interacting with their dark matter halo. Investigating bar formation and reproducing their observed properties in cosmological simulations is important for understanding galaxy formation, as well as understanding the formation of galactic bars. We study 13 high resolution MW-mass galaxies from the zoomed-in cosmo-hydro simulation FIRE2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) to first ask: Do the FIRE galaxies have bars? If so, how do bars form and when does bar formation fail? We find examples where bars form due to satellite interactions and others where bars form secularly in the disk. Using predictions from isolated galaxy simulations for varied dark matter and stellar distributions at the galaxy centre, we explain the morphological differences between the bars in FIRE2 and TNG50 and connect them to differences in the physics implementations of the two codes. We find that the stellar feedback prescription in FIRE2, which affects starburst and gas dynamics, and the lack of blackhole feedback to mitigate the gas in the galaxy center, together make the disk kinematically hot, such that bars are shorter than the MW-bar, rotate faster, and are mostly short-lived. We hypothesize that the FIRE3 simulations will address some of the issues with improved stellar feedback and AGN, such that bars are more close to that in observations.",Bar formation and destruction in the FIRE2 simulations.
Virginia Cuomo (1),"The buckling instability of the bar explains the formation of boxy/peanut (B/P) bulges. During a buckling event, the bar bends, so the symmetry in the density distribution with respect to the mid-plane is broken. We use simulations to show that, when the buckling instability is strong, a residual mid-plane asymmetry persists and we develop a diagnostic test to quantify it in nearly edge-on galaxies. We apply our diagnostic to a small sample of galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies to show that it can be successfully applied to real galaxies. We find no evidence of mid-plane asymmetry clearly associated to a past buckling event. We conclude that the formation of B/P bulges through strong buckling may be a rare event. We suggest our diagnostic can be applied to the Milky Way to explore the formation scenario of the B/P bulge hosted in our Galaxy.",Evidence of a Buckling Event in Nearly Edge-On Galaxies: Simulations and Observations 
Virginia Cuomo (2),"Stellar bars play a crucial role in driving the secular evolution of their host galaxies. Indeed, they rotate around the galaxy centre with a given angular frequency, the bar pattern speed, sweeping material within the central regions of the galaxy and driving strong structural modifications. In the standard LCDM model, bars are expected to slow down by efficiently exchanging angular momentum with the other galaxy components and/or through dynamical friction exerted by the dark matter halo. The only direct method to derive the bar pattern speed, the Tremaine-Weinberg method, revealed that real bars rotate fast, stressing a tension between the observations, conducted to date in the local universe, and the LCDM model. Measuring the bar pattern speed by applying the Tremaine-Weinberg method to bars up to z~1-2 will reveal if the expected bar evolutionary path is actually taking place and/or to confirm if the dark matter is able to exert an efficient friction. Using high resolution N-body simulations we tested and confirmed the applicability of the Tremaine-Weinberg method to deep spectroscopy of the NIRSpec IFU mounted to the JWST for a sample of bars at z~1-2 recently revealed with the CEERS NIRCam. Here we present the result of our preliminary analysis, which will be used to prepare an observational proposal to get dedicated NIRSpec@JWST in the next call.",Bar pattern speeds at z~1-2 to explore challenges of the standard cosmology
Abdurrahman Naufal,"In the local Universe, we observe that environment has an important role in affecting the structure and morphology of galaxies, as well as their physical properties. In the densest environments such as galaxy clusters, galaxies are predominantly quiescent ellipticals, while in less dense environments star-forming disk galaxies are more prevalent. How and when environment starts to play such role is an important question in galaxy evolution. Protoclusters—overdense regions at high redshift thought to be the progenitors of today’s galaxy clusters—are unique laboratories to investigate how environment affects the properties of galaxies in the earlier stages of their evolution. With the increasing number of protoclusters surveyed, we aim to characterize the structure and morphology of galaxies in protoclusters to investigate their environmental dependence. We compile catalogs of four protoclusters at z ∼ 2 (PKS 1138-262, USS 1558-003, PHz G237.0+42.5, and CC 2.2) consisting of 331 Hα-emitting star-forming galaxies (HAE) and characterize their size and apparent morphologies observed by the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera Surveys (HST/ACS) in the F814W filter. We compare the structures of 138 HAEs in protoclusters detected by HST/ACS to a coeval comparison field sample of 462 HAEs. We measure the size by Sérsic profile fitting as well as the morphologies by non-parametric methods. We find the size distributions of protocluster and field HAEs at are similar with typical half-light radius of ∼ 2.5 kpc. At fixed stellar mass, there is no significant difference between HAE in protocluster and in field. Stacking analyses also show similar results. This result suggests that the environment does not significantly affect the size of galaxies during the star-forming phase. Based on Sérsic index and non-parametric morphologies, HAE morphologies at z~2 in rest-frame UV are consistent with disk-like star-forming galaxies, although we also find ∼20% HAEs have peculiar morphologies. We find that rotocluster HAEs are slightly more concentrated than field HAEs, especially in the highly star-forming subsamples. If we interpret peculiar morphologies as merger candidates according on Gini-M20 merger statistics, we estimate the merger fraction in protoclusters is 38 ± 7% protocluster and 26 ± 3% field. We also find that there is twice more peculiar galaxies above star-forming main sequence than below it, suggesting the correlation between starbursts and peculiar morphologies, which may be caused by the presence giant star-forming clumps or merger signatures.",Environmental effects on the morphology of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2
Andras Peter Joo,"IllustrisTNG is a suite of large volume, cosmological, gravo-magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including a comprehensive model for galaxy formation. Each TNG simulation self-consistently solves for the coupled evolution of dark matter, cosmic gas, luminous stars, and supermassive blackholes from redshift z=127 to 0 and generates 100 resulting snapshots from z=20 to 0. We used the TNG100 run for analysis, which has the size of 110.7^3 Mpc^3 and contains more than 10 billion resolution elements. Our goal is to create a sample of galaxies in TNG that are possible hosts for long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs). LGRBs are violent core-collapse events of massive stars that indicate intense star formation and can be detected at cosmic distances. Therefore, comparing the galaxy properties of this LGRB host sample with the whole population could highlight specialities of star forming galaxies at high redshifts. Our approach is to find mergers where one progenitor has low metallicity and the descendant galaxy has large star formation rate (SFR). We are analysing this sample statistically for every snapshot to be able to compare with observational LGRB host samples and refine our model. We processed the catalogue data and merger trees for all snapshots of the TNG100 run and gathered all the subhalo properties found by the subfind algorithm with non-zero metallicity that took part in a merger event. We filtered the events so, that one of the progenitors has low metallicity, that is, lower than the mass-weighted average metallicity at z=2, and the descendant galaxy has higher SFR than the average at the given redshift. We then gathered all properties of the filtered progenitor galaxies and the descendant galaxies of the mergers. Here we showcase a few of our statistical analysis of the galaxy properties in our sample.",Investigating galaxy mergers in the IllustrisTNG universe simulation

Benjamin Metha,"Star forming galaxies in the local universe take the shapes of grand-design spirals, with a larger fraction of metals in their centre than on their outskirts, often modelled by a linear gradient. On the other hand, star forming galaxies at cosmic noon are more irregular, with large, kpc-scale metal rich clumps. The linear gradient models that describe the local universe cannot be applied to these distant galaxies. In this talk, I demonstrate the potential of geostatistical modelling to improve our understanding of the chemical substructures of galaxies at both low- and high-redshift (z ~ 3). By fitting a hierarchical model to JWST-GLASS data, I investigate how the spatial extent of metal-rich clumps evolves throughout cosmic time. This enables an understanding on the spread of metals throughout galaxies on sub-kpc scales, testing subgrid models of metal mixing and ultimately improving our understanding of galaxy evolution.",Connecting small-scale metallicity fluctuations of local galaxies with galaxies at cosmic noon observed by JWST

In order to get the pure lens candidates, we need to minimize the false positives in our sample. So, the first step is to search for the massive potential deflectors.

Chloe Cheng,"Crucial insights into the chemical enrichment, assembly, and star formation histories of disc galaxies can be gained by examining the fossil records encoded in their descendants across cosmic time.  Thus, in order for us to truly comprehend these late-type galaxies and how they evolve, quiescent, early-type galaxies (ETGs) at high redshifts must first be fully characterized.  Previously, we measured integrated chemical abundance patterns in a large sample of massive ETGs at 0.6 ≤ z ≤ 0.75 from the LEGA-C survey.  These results have revealed fascinating conclusions about chemical enrichment regulation, star formation timescales, and galaxy quenching.  However, galaxies’ detailed star formation and assembly histories are imprinted in the spatial distributions of their chemical abundances.  In this work, we measure spatially-resolved stellar population parameters in the LEGA-C ETGs by employing full-spectrum stellar population synthesis models over different apertures.  These models simultaneously fit for ages, metallicities, and detailed chemical abundances.  We discuss our findings concerning stellar population gradients and their implications for galaxy evolution.  In the near future, these methods will be applied to our approved Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program, extending this analysis to higher redshifts (1.0 < z < 2.5) and encompassing star-forming and quiescent galaxies.

Such an episodic star formation pattern is well synced with a pulsating motion of the circumgalactic gas, which, on the one hand receives angular momentum modulations from the large-scale environment, yielding in-spiralling gas to fuel the star-forming reservoir; on the other hand, is affected by the feedback activities from the galaxy centre. As a result,  a present-day star-forming galaxy may have gone through several cycles of star-forming and quiescent phases during its evolutionary history, with the circumgalactic gas carrying out a synchronized cadence of ""breathing in and out"" motions out to ∼100 kpc. ",Linking episodic star formation with the large-scale angular-momentum environment through circumgalactic medium
Daniel McPherson,"The early growth of disk galaxies was significantly impacted by galaxy scale winds. Current models of galaxy evolution propose that these outflows regulate star-formation by removing star-forming material from the galaxy disk and enrich the surrounding circumgalactic medium with higher metallicity gas. However, direct observations of outflows at redshifts corresponding to early disk growth (z>3) are extremely difficult, even with JWST, due to their faintness. I will discuss detailed imaging with Keck/KCWI of outflows in local star bursting, high [OIII] EW, low metallicity (~5-10% solar) disk galaxies, which we can use as analogues of the early universe. I have created  sub-kiloparsec resolved maps of the outflows reaching  ~10 kpc from the disk, and directly measure opening angle, covering fraction and mass loading factors. I present a new method for characterising star-formation driven outflows in edge on galaxies, which can be applied to larger surveys with JWST or in the future ELT. I also will present work making direct estimates of the metallicity of the outflow using the auroral emission lines. This represents the first ever full image of the baryon cycle, as viewed through metallicity, on a starbursting disk galaxy. We can use these observations to inform models of how the Milky Way may have grown early on, and to help interpretation of results from JWST.",Resolved Images of Outflows in Edge-On Metal-Poor Starbursts
Enci Wang,"I will talk about the formation of exponential star-forming disk and the corresponding metal enrichment in the modified accretion disk (MAD) framework.  The MAD is suggested by the recent simulations that coplanar gas inflow mainly provides the fuel of star formation. We treat the galactic gas disk as a simple gas-regulator system that the SFR is instantaneously determined by the gas content, which is regulated by the interplay between inflow, outflow  and star formation. Based on this simple model, we can obtain the analytic solution of radial profile of the gas-phase metallicity, which well characterises the overall features of the observed ones. The negative gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a natural consequence of the radial inflow of cold gas which is continuously enriched by in-situ star formation.  We also show that magnetic stresses from magneto-rotational instability are the most plausible source of the required viscosity that sustains the exponential star-forming disk.  ",The formation of exponential star-forming disk and the corresponding metal enrichment in the modified accretion disk framework
Hajime Fukushima,"By performing 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of disk galaxies, we study the impacts of feedback processes of massive stars on star formation in the local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPG). We include radiation and supernova (SN) feedback. We find that the photoionized gas is rapidly evaporated from the galaxies because the thermal pressure is stronger than the gravitational force. Thus, the photoionization feedback effectively suppresses star formation before the SN feedback turns on. In low-metallicity cases with < 0.1Zsun, the star formation is more suppressed due to smaller dust attenuation. We compare the simulation results with the recent observations of local EMPGs with H-alpha emission. Our results match well with the observed surface brightness distribution of H-alpha line.

Hannah Uebler,"JWST enables for the first time observations of rest-frame optical emission lines such as Halpha or [OIII] in star-forming galaxies at 3<z<9. These lines have been well studied at lower redshifts, allowing us to directly connect early galaxy formation to later phases in cosmic history.  With JWST’s NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) we can study spatially resolved emission lines to measure and model the kinematics of early galaxies. I will present first results from the Galaxy Assembly IFS program of 42 3<z<9 galaxies of the NIRSpec GTO team, with a focus on disk galaxy kinematics and outflows. Our data will provide important constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation, and aid the interpretation of complementary studies with ALMA of e.g. [CII] kinematics.",Early disk galaxies and resolved ionised gas kinematics at 3<z<7
Hidenobu Yajima,"Observations by JWST have successfully discovered candidates of galaxies at redshifts greater than ten (e.g., Donnan et al. 2022; Naidu et al. 2022). Interestingly, some candidates indicate quite large stellar masses (e.g., Harikane et al. 2022) and extended or very compact sizes (Ono et al. 2022). To understand the galaxy formation in the early Universe and develop theoretical models for comparisons with JWST or ALMA data, we perform cosmological radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of the first massive galaxy formation with a new simulation project: FOREVER22 (Yajima et al. 2022, MNRAS, 509, 4037). We find that galaxies in overdense regions have high star formation rates larger than ten solar masses per year at z=10 and their stellar masses reach 10^9 solar masses. The morphology of galaxies drastically changes with time via major mergers and stellar feedback, which nicely match recent observations by JWST. In my talk, I will also present multi-wavelength radiative properties of galaxies with radiative transfer simulations. ",Formation of the first massive galaxies in cosmological simulations and their observation properties
Kazuki Daikuhara,"Low mass galaxies at high redshifts are the building blocks of more massive galaxies at later times and are thus key populations for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. We have made deep narrow-band observations for two proto-clusters and the general field in COSMOS at z~2. In a clumpy young proto-cluster, USS1558, at z=2.53, we find many star-forming galaxies well above the star-forming main sequence at the low-mass end for the field galaxies. This suggests that some environmental effects may be at work in low-mass galaxies in high-density regions to enhance their star-forming activities. On the massive side of USS1558, as well as in a more evolved proto-cluster, PKS1138 at z=2.16, no significant differences in the distribution on the main sequence diagram are found compared to the field galaxies. We also find that the star-forming activity within individual galaxies in the proto-clusters is more centrally concentrated than those in the field. This is probably due to the enhanced interactions between galaxies in the proto-cluster, which can lose the angular momentum of the gas, drive it towards the galaxy center, and lead to a central starburst. Moreover, due to the depth of our observations, we have discovered unique objects that are detected only in the narrow-band and not in the broad-bands. These objects are expected to be very young galaxies in formation with intense star formation but with extremely low stellar mass yet.",Enhanced star forming activity at the low-mass end in a young proto-cluster at the cosmic noon
Koki Otaki,"The standard galaxy formation model predicts that galaxies form in a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halo and that galaxies are dominated by dark matter. However, recent observations have discovered dark-matter-deficient galaxies with much less dark matter mass than theoretical predictions, and the process of their formation has been discussed. Here, we investigate the physical processes of galaxy formation by collisions between gas-rich dark matter subhalos (DMSHs) within the context of the CDM paradigm. Prior to a numerical simulation, we analyze a bifurcation between the formation of dark-matter-dominated galaxies and dark-matter-deficient galaxies, corresponding to the collision velocity of DMSHs moving in a host halo. In the case of low-speed collisions, a dark-matter-dominated galaxy is formed by merging two DMSHs. However, the two DMSHs penetrate each other, but the gaseous mediums collide, forming a dwarf galaxy without dark matter for the middle-speed encounter. Shock-breakout occurs due to the shock waves generated at the collision surface reaching the gas surface, and there is no galaxy formation in the case of high-speed collisions. Then, we simulate head-on collisions between DMSHs with the same mass range from 10^7 Msun to 10^10 Msun. The results show that dark-matter-deficient galaxies with total masses ranging from 10^7 Msun to 10^9 Msun are formed from the colliding gas with 0.1 solar metallicity, depending on the mass of DMSHs and the collision velocities.",Physical conditions for collision-induced formation of galaxies
Konstantinos Kouroumpatzakis,"The stellar mass (Mstar), and star-formation rate (SFR) are fundamental characteristics of galaxies that are strongly linked with their evolution and current state. Therefore, acquiring precise measurements of these properties is essential for galaxy studies. Current calibrations that linearly convert the infrared (IR) luminosity to SFR lead to extensive scatter while they are biased towards highly star-forming/dusty galaxies. In this work we utilize the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE in order to build a large library of galaxy models covering a wide range of star-forming conditions, and interstellar medium (ISM) properties. We provide a new SFR calibration using a combination of the WISE Band-1 (3 um) and Band-3 (12 um), as well as, the JWST NIR-200W (2 um) and MIRI-2100W (21 um). Adding a stellar mass tracer in the SFR calibrations allow us to account for the contribution of old stellar populations in the heating of the dust, providing more reliable SFR estimations across the SFR range, and especially for low-SFR galaxies. In addition, by including the extinction as a parameter (when it is available) we obtain more reliable IR-based SFR, even for low dust-content galaxies, without the need for hybrid (e.g. IR+ultraviolet) SFR indicators. Furthermore, we provide updated calibrations for the mass-to-light ratio for the WISE band-1, and JWST NIR-200W bands, which account for the effect of extinction on the optical colours of the stellar populations. Furthermore, by knowing the galaxies’ star-formation histories and ISM condition we are able to quantification the role of these factors in the bias and scatter of the estimated SFRs for galaxies with different specific SFR and dust content. The calibrations are provided separately through Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC), and machine learning fitting techniques that give similar results, showing that they are method independent.","New infrared stellar mass, and star-formation rate calibrations, and their dependence on stellar-population age and extinction"
Li-Wen Liao,"Radial color gradients within galaxies arise from stellar population gradients. Large samples of color gradients can be measured in wide-area imaging surveys to complement much smaller samples of spectroscopic IFU observations and provide statistical constraints on galaxy evolution models. Here we measure color gradients for low-redshift galaxies (z&lt;0.1) using photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey. Our sample comprises ~63,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and ~480,000 galaxies with photometric redshifts. We find the color gradients of most galaxies in this sample are negative (redder in the center), consistent with the literature. We investigate the relationship between color gradient, overall g-r and r-z color, Mr, M*, and sSFR. We find that redder galaxies tend to have steeper color gradients. Trends of gradients with Mr (M*) show an inflection around Mr~ -21 (log 10 M*/Msun ~10.5). For less massive galaxies, color gradients become steeper with increasing M*, whereas color gradients in more massive galaxies become shallower. We also compute color gradients for Illustris-TNG galaxies using mock SDSS images. The trends with Mr and M* in the simulation are consistent with our observational results but the trends of g-r and sSFR behave differently. We attribute this to an excess of low-redshift star formation in massive TNG galaxies. Overall, our results support concordance CDM galaxy formation theory, in which galaxies assemble inside-out through dissipative collapse and star formation is strongly suppressed by AGN feedback above a critical mass.",Galaxy Color Gradients in the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey
Maarten Baes,"Cosmological hydrodynamics simulations are a valuable tool in the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies. To calibrate these simulations and make quantitative predictions, an apples-to-apples comparison to observational data is required. This is not trivial: hydrodynamics simulations generate intrinsic properties such as stellar masses and SFRs, which are not directly comparable to the measured properties of observed galaxies. We have developed the forward modelling tool SKIRT to generate realistic synthetic images, SEDs and spectra for galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. The mock observations account for the different stellar populations, the disturbing effects of the dusty ISM, and the 3D geometry of galaxies, and they can immediately be compared to observational data. We present the latest results on the comparison of synthetic data from different cosmological simulations (EAGLE, TNG, Auriga, ARTEMIS…) to observational data from UV to mm wavelengths. We derive the cosmic spectral energy distribution, multi-band luminosity functions, and scaling relations for different cosmological simulations, and compare these to recent observations. The results of this comparison reveal overall agreement between the simulations and observations, both in the SEDs and in the derived physical properties, with several interesting discrepancies. We also present high-resolution multi-wavelength imaging data for a large suite of Milky Way-type galaxies, and we make a morphological comparison with well-resolved spiral galaxies in the Local Universe. We find that simulated galaxies largely reproduce the observed morphological trends as a function of wavelength, although they appear to be more clumpy and less symmetrical than observed.",Apples-to-apples comparisons between cosmological simulations and observations from UV to mm wavelengths

Micheli Trindade Moura,"Relic galaxies are massive, compact and quiescent objects observed in the local Universe that have not experienced any significant interaction episodes or merger events since z=2, remaining unaltered since their formation. These galaxies with frozen history can provide important clues about the intrinsic processes related to the formation and evolution of massive ETGs. Using the high resolution cosmological simulation Illustris TNG-50, we investigate the assembly history of a sample of massive and compact early-type galaxies (ETGs) at z=0, and compare them with relic galaxies that had similar formation conditions, focusing on the mechanisms that led relic galaxies and the compact massive ETGs to have distinct evolutionary pathways across the cosmic time. We use two numerical approaches to investigate the different pathways of our sample: kinematic effects on subhalos based on separation of stellar constituents into different  morphological components, and the global environmental framework. Here we will show the results based on the kinematic dynamical decomposition of the simulated galaxies. Our preliminary results indicate that there is a trend of some galaxies to keep the disk component preserved until  z = 0, showing dynamical signatures in the orbital angular momentum of stellar particles, which in turn can be used as orbital parameter to look for similar structures in observations.",Dynamical pathways of evolution of relic galaxies and compact massive ETGs
Miftahul Hilmi,"The intergalactic matter in the universe undergoes a phase transition from neutral to ionized state in the first billion years, termed as ""cosmic reionization”. Lyman-break galaxies (LBG) are the leading candidate sources for producing the necessary ionizing radiation. Unfortunately, photometric selections of high-redshift LBGs are potentially subject to contamination from low/intermediate redshift galaxies with a prominent 4000 Å Balmer break that may have observer-frame spectral energy distributions mimicking a Lyman-break. To investigate in a novel way the impact of contamination, we study the spatial correlation between intermediate (z ~ 1.3 — 2) and high redshift (z ~ 6 — 8) galaxies in Hubble Space Telescope large-area surveys and link it to the leakage fraction. We compare the observed correlations for various Hubble Space Telescope surveys to outcomes from Monte Carlo simulations of leakage. Our results indicate that while ultradeep observations in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field appear to have negligible contamination, larger area surveys such as the CANDELS GOODS-S and BoRG might have underestimated the purity of photometric samples.",A Novel Analysis of Contamination in Lyman Break Galaxy Samples at z ~ 6 − 8: Spatial Correlation with Intermediate-redshift Galaxies at z ~ 1.3 − 2

Monserrat Martinez-Marin,"From ground-based telescope observations, we have detected a large number of massive disk-like galaxies at redshifts z>3. Understanding how these galaxies build up their mass of around 10**11 within the 1 to 2 Gyrs of the universe is crucial to understand galaxy formation and hierarchical simulations. We present a sample of 17 massive around 10**11 galaxies at 3<z<4 based on deep H and K−band spectra using the Keck/MOSFIRE and VLT/KMOS near-infrared spectrographs. We find high-velocity dispersion of order 255 km/s based on [OIII] and Hbeta emission lines. We combine these with size measurements based on HST/WFC3 F160W imaging to infer dynamical masses. The small effective radius of 2.9 +- 0.15 is broadly consistent with the high stellar masses. The UVJ rest frame colors show that our sample is composited by star-forming galaxies and the [OIII]/Hbeta ratios. The mass excitation plot determines the presence of AGNs, which can influence the rapid quenching experience by massive galaxies in the early universe. The dynamical masses are consistent with the stellar masses for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF).

Pavel E. Mancera Piña (1),"Understanding the relation between the observed properties of galaxies and those theoretically expected from their parent dark matter haloes is one of the major goals of present-day astrophysics. In this context, the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is one of the most powerful benchmarks of galaxy evolution models. Rotation curve decomposition provides one of the best constraints on the SHMR of disc galaxies in the local Universe. However, at higher redshifts, this technique remains somewhat unexploited, owing to the difficulty in obtaining reliable rotation curves. I will present new results on the SHMR of disc galaxies at z=1, when the Universe was roughly its current age. The results are based on a set of robust rotation curves  from non-parametric state-of-the-art kinematic modelling of resolved IFU observations and robust mass modelling within a Bayesian framework. In contrast to recent claims, our rotation curves remain flat out to the outermost observed radii. I will present a comparison between the observed SHMR and its theoretical counterpart from abundance-matching, highlighting their similarities and discrepancies and discussing the physical processes behind them. I will highlight how understanding these results is crucial to benchmark the SHMR and other scaling relations in the era of JWST.",The dark matter haloes of disc galaxies at z=1
Pavel E. Mancera Piña (2),"Mass and angular momentum are two of the most fundamental parameters regulating the evolution of disc galaxies (e.g. their size, morphology, stellar and gas content) through cosmic time, as seen since early models of galaxy formation. While the relation between stellar mass and stellar specific angular momentum has been well studied in the literature at z<2, its baryonic counterpart (which  provides a more robust and integral view of angular momentum in galaxies in different mass regimes) remains relatively unexplored even at z=0, providing no benchmark for upcoming studies at high z. In this talk, I will present results regarding the baryonic specific angular momentum of nearby disc galaxies, which we have recently derived using a large sample of galaxies with the highest available quality in their stellar surface brightness profiles and gas kinematics. We find that the relation between the baryonic mass (M_bar) and the baryonic specific angular momentum (j_bar) of disc galaxies is a well defined, unbroken power law across four orders of magnitude in M_bar and j_bar, with spiral and dwarf galaxies lying along the same sequence, opposite to previous claims. Our relation also implies that disc galaxies at z=0 retain on average about 70% the value of the specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes. Moreover, we find a new scaling relation between the gas content of galaxies and their mass and angular momentum. The plane defined by these quantities has an extremely low intrinsic scatter, making our new relation one of the tightest empirical scaling relations of galaxies. Even extreme galaxies like ""super-spiral"", ""super-thin"", or ""ultra-diffuse"" galaxies follow this relation rather closely, highlighting the fundamental nature of the new scaling law. This scaling law can be directly used to test the outcomes of models and simulations, and will provide a crucial comparison benchmark for upcoming high-z observations. I will briefly discuss the possible physical mechanisms that give rise (or not) to such relation, in particular those related with gas disc instabilities.",The baryonic specific angular momentum of nearby disc galaxies
Preetish Mishra,"Classic galaxy formation models predict a fundamental link between galaxy size and halo virial radius. Several past studies (Kravtsov 2013, Sommerville et al. 2018) have reported a single linear relation between halo radius and sizes of galaxies of different mass and morphologies. However, these studies have employed abundance matching ansatz to map observed galaxies onto simulated dark matter haloes which involves various assumptions regarding galaxy-halo connection. In this work, we re-examine the relation between sizes of galaxies and dark matter haloes using weak gravitational lensing which provides a direct way of probing dark matter distribution around luminous galaxies. Our sample consists of ~270,000 galaxies more massive than logM*=9 and within z<0.3 drawn from Subaru-HSC survey PDR2.  We measure the galaxy half-light radius by fitting a single Sersic light profile to galaxy images and find galaxy size-stellar mass relation. We divide our sample galaxies into bins of stellar mass and obtain corresponding stacked weak lensing signals. We model the signals to infer stellar mass-halo mass relation. Finally, we combine galaxy size - stellar mass relation and stellar mass - halo mass relation to map galaxy sizes onto dark matter haloes. We find that the galaxy size - halo radius relation is not linear and depends on the stellar mass of galaxies. The ratio of galaxy size/halo radius decreases by a factor of two as one moves from low mass dwarf/disk galaxies to high mass early-type galaxies. These qualitative trends do not change even if we use different stellar mass - halo mass relations from previous works. Our results set the low redshift benchmark on the inherent differences between low-mass disks and high-mass early-type galaxies with respect to their parent dark matter haloes. Similar work at higher redshifts using space-based missions like JWST will be crucial for understanding the buildup of such differences in halo properties of disks and early-type galaxies.

Tim Rawle,"The integral field unit (IFU) on JWST NIRSpec is a powerful tool for delving into the spatial detail of near-infrared sources, but its single-object nature will make the compilation of large statistical samples beyond its purview.

Tucker Jones,"Spatially resolved spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for studying the formation and evolution of disk galaxies at high redshifts. This technique is most powerful when combining the diffraction limit of large telescopes with strong gravitational lensing, providing the best possible spatial resolution and sensitivity. I will discuss observations of lensed star forming galaxies spanning the stellar mass range expected for Milky Way progenitors at “cosmic noon” (z~1-3). Measurements of the resolved kinematics, star formation, gas metallicity distribution, and outflows together show that energetic feedback from star formation plays a dramatic role in disk galaxy formation at these redshifts. This feedback may even destroy gaseous disks and alter dark matter density profiles at the lowest observed masses (Mstar < 10^9 Msun), as indicated by the data and comparison with cosmological simulations. The disk fraction shows a clear mass dependence, with rotation-dominated disk galaxies being more common at higher masses, although with high velocity dispersions (i.e. “thick disk” kinematics). I will also describe a novel JWST Cycle 1 program (GO-02136) which aims to establish the emergence of the first dynamically cold “thin disk” galaxies by mapping the kinematics of ~50 galaxies at z~0.5-1.5. JWST provides 5-10 times better spatial resolution than ground-based efforts at these redshifts, where moderately massive galaxies are expected to transition from turbulent thick disks to the thin spiral disks of the modern Hubble sequence.

These observations allowed us to compare the spatial distribution and extension of the [C II] and rest-frame UV emission, and model the [C II] line data-cube. The system is found to be composed of a main central source, a fainter north extension, and candidate [C II] companions located 10-kpc away. The [C II] velocity map reveals a velocity gradient in the north-south direction suggesting ordered motion, as commonly found in rotating-disk galaxies. If this rotating nature is confirmed, a low average velocity dispersion implies a dispersion lower than the expected value from observations and semi-analytic models of high redshift galaxies.

Ananda Hota,"AGN-feedback has been the most popular model to explain galaxy evolution through mergers. However in no sample the relic evidence of an AGN feedback has been age-dated to be of similar time-scale with the time since the decline of star formation in a post-merger,  post-starburst, early-type galaxy. In this context jet-galaxy interaction or understanding of how a jet interacts with the gaseous/stellar component of a galaxy is critical. Compared to relic evidence in optical (like Hanny’s Voorwerp) which are of a few ten thousand years old only, the relics of radio jets can be a few 100 million years old and diffuse out to far beyond the optical extent of galaxies, up to a few Mpc size. Hence to discover and study faint-fuzzy relic evidence from survey data, citizen science is not only most-effective but also has many other socio-scientific benefits. Hence, we employed a citizen science approach but to address the complexity of heterogeneous, multi-wavelength and multi-telescope data, and angular-scale sensitive radio-interferometric images we modified it to a research collaboratory of trained citizen scientists. After a face-to-face training to University-level science-educated citizens/students, hosted free-of-cost by  various research institutes, citizen scientists continue interactive-learning and discover exotic radio galaxies from their respective homes, primarily using free internet services. These preliminary discoveries are then followed up with the GMRT telescope. We shall present a few of our most-interesting discoveries. Such objects include new Speca-like rare spiral-host radio galaxies, new cases of rare jet-galaxy interactions, never-seen-before relic radio bubbles and filaments in elliptical-elliptical mergers etc. Speca which has avoided merger but successfully grown its spinning supermassive black hole to launch Mpc-scale jets are possibly the first massive disk galaxies formed with spinning black holes at early-Universe. We believe that Big Data being created by new surveys is a Big Opportunity, if we adopt this Collaboratory approach to citizen science which is considered a powerful medium for achieving Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations.  Note that along with an Oral talk I can conduct a small Outreach or citizen science workshop to expose interested University-students to extragalactic astronomy similar to that I am conducting in IAU-Symposium-375 (Reference: https://multimessengerchakra2022.physics.uoc.gr/educational-programme/ )   ",From nearby Seyferts to high-z SPECAs: RAD@home citizen science discovering relics of AGN feedback
Bijaya Chandra Luitel,"The star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy is related to its molecular gas mass by the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, which posits a power-law relationship between the two variables. Whilst this empirically derived law has previously been observed in galaxies over a wide range of redshift, we observed several galaxies at high redshift that show non-detections or only marginal detections of the usual gas mass tracer, the carbon monoxide (CO) J=1-0 transition. We fit a spectral energy distribution (SED), using data in the ultraviolet and optical bands from the Hubble space telescope and the millimetre bands from the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) to our sample of galaxies in order to constrain their SFR, using which we make predicted (CO) J=1-0 maps. Thereafter, we compare our results with the observational non-detections.",CO non-detections of dusty Main Sequence galaxies at z~3
Chelsea Sharon,"Theoretical work suggests that AGN play an important role in ending star formation in massive galaxies. In addition to molecular outflows observed in the local universe, emission from very high-J CO rotational transitions have been a key piece of evidence for AGN directly affecting the molecular gas reservoirs that fuel star formation. However, very few observations exist of CO rotational lines past the peak of the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) for galaxies in the early universe. Here we will present ALMA observations of high-J CO rotational lines (J_upper>10) in several z>2 IR-bright galaxies. We will discuss the heterogenous results for the sample's AGN and AGN-free galaxies, as well as the unique spectral signatures that suggest AGN are affecting some of these galaxies' molecular gas.",Signatures of AGN Feedback in High-z Galaxies' Molecular Gas
Elham Eftekhari,"High-resolution Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of galaxies is one of the youngest branches of extragalactic astrophysics with huge scientific potential. It is opening new windows in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, and it will certainly have a major role in the JWST era. In our recent work, we assessed the long-believed explanation of the origin of strong CO absorptions in the NIR spectrum of massive ETGs, i.e. due to the substantial contribution from intermediate-age stellar populations. The evidence for this explanation is not robust and the scenario is in sharp contrast with the rather old populations of massive ETGs inferred from the studies in the optical range. We obtained the spectrum of the prototype of relic galaxies (low-redshift equivalents of compact massive disk galaxies at z~2), i.e. NGC1277, with the EMIR spectrograph at the largest telescope in the world operating in the NIR (i.e. the Gran Telescopio Canarias; 10.4m diameter) and compared the CO absorption features of this galaxy with the ones of a representative sample of massive ETGs. We ruled out intermediate-age stellar populations origin of CO-strong absorptions in massive ETGs, providing a better way to reconcile the picture that we get of galaxy formation and evolution in the NIR with the one from optical.",New insights into the puzzle of strong CO absorption features in massive ETGs from the NIR spectroscopy of the disk galaxy NGC1277
Enrico Di Teodoro,"I will present our latest results on the most massive disk galaxies in the local Universe. Using new HI observations of a sample of very massive disks (M_*>10^11 Msun), we derived extended HI rotation curves and mass models, and obtained robust estimates of their halo masses. We confirmed that massive galaxies lie on the continuation of the Tully-Fisher relation (mass-velocity) and of the Fall relation (angular momentum-mass), in both their stellar and baryonic versions, with no clear break or bend at the high-mass end. The connection between baryons and dark matter is studied through the stellar-to-halo mass relation. We observed that massive disc galaxies systematically inhabit less massive halos than predicted by abundance matching prescriptions, i.e. the ratio M_halo / M_* monotonically increases with mass and does not turn over at the high-mass end. We also found that discs retain a significant fraction of the halo specific angular momentum, with little or no dependence on mass. Our findings indicate that discs are a self-similar population of objects closely linked to their to dark matter halos. Our results point towards a picture where, differently from massive spheroids, massive discs grow efficiently throughout cosmic time, without experiencing disruptive events like strong feedback and/or major mergers.

Fatemeh Tabatabaei (1),"Investigating the thermal and non-thermal processes in galaxies is vital to understand their evolution over cosmic time.  This can be best studied by combining the emission observed in the optical and radio domains in galaxies. The JWST will soon resolve the evolution of the thermal processes by mapping ionized gas and dust in distant galaxies. These information combined with the upcoming deep SKA surveys will make a major break through in mapping the non-thermal processes and understanding their role in the evolution of galaxies. Based on our recent simulations, the SKA1-MID surveys will be able to trace the evolution history of spiral galaxies such as M51 and NGC 6946 back to a redshift of z=3. This study indicates that the non-thermal pressure inserted by cosmic rays and magnetic fields can have played an important role in the evolution of structures at earlier cosmic times.",Role of the ISM/IGM Energy Balance in Structure Formation and Evolution of Galaxies
Fatemeh Tabatabaei (2),"Resolved maps of the thermal and nonthermal radio continuum (RC) emission of distant galaxies are a powerful tool for understanding the role of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the evolution of galaxies. We simulate the RC surface brightness of present-day star forming galaxies in the past at $0.15<z<3$  considering two cases of radio size evolution: (1)~no evolution, and (2)~same evolution as in the optical. We aim to investigate the a)~structure of the thermal and nonthermal emission on kpc scales, b)~evolution of the thermal fraction and synchrotron spectrum at mid-radio frequencies ($\simeq$1-10\,GHz), and c)~capability of the proposed SKA1-MID reference surveys in detecting the RC emitting structures. The synchrotron spectrum flattens with $z$ causing curvature in the observed mid-radio SEDs of galaxies at higher $z$. The spectral index reported in recent observational studies agrees better with the no size evolution scenario. In this case, the mean thermal fraction observed at 1.4\,GHz increases with redshift by more than 30\% from $z=0.15$ to $z=2$ because of the drop of the synchrotron emission at higher rest-frame~frequencies. More massive galaxies have lower thermal fractions and experience a faster flattening of the nonthermal spectrum. The proposed SKA1-MID band~2 reference survey, unveils the ISM in M51- and NGC6946-like galaxies (with ${\rm M_{\star}}\simeq10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) up to $z=3$. This survey detects lower-mass galaxies like M33 (${\rm M_{\star}}\simeq10^{9}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) only at low redshifts $z\lesssim 0.5$. For a proper separation of the RC emitting processes at the peak of star formation, it is vital to include band~1 into the SKA1-MID reference surveys.",Evolution of thermal and nonthermal radio continuum emission on kpc scales--Predictions for SKA
Fernanda Roman de Oliveira,"Recent discoveries of dynamically cold disc galaxies at z > 4 have challenged galaxy formation models that predict, instead, chaotic systems as a consequence of copious gas accretion, mergers and efficient feedback. I will present 3D dynamical models of 4 of the most well-resolved galaxies with ALMA, seen in the [CII] 158 micron emission at z ~ 4.5. The sample is diverse in galaxy type and all galaxies show evidence of radial motions that could be due to minor mergers or gas accretion. However, we found that all of them host regularly rotating discs with gas velocity dispersions that are significantly lower than predicted by current cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with ratios of ordered-to-random motions (V/sigma) ranging from 2.6 to 9. We have also estimated the thickness of the gas discs and found that they are of the order of 1 kpc, similar to thick discs of local galaxies like the Milky Way. These findings show that dynamically cold discs can form earlier than previously thought and suggest that some thick discs could be formed in-situ in the early stages of galaxy formation.",Diverse dynamically cold discs at z ~ 4.5 as seen with ALMA
Francesca Rizzo,"The dynamics of high redshift galaxies reveals important clues on their formation and assembly, providing also strong constraints on galaxy formation models. Measurements of the gas rotation allow us to trace the distribution of the different matter components and study galaxy scaling relations. In contrast, measurements of the gas velocity dispersions give information about the turbulence within the interstellar medium, mainly driven by stellar feedback and gravitational instabilities. At the moment, dynamical studies of high-z galaxies have been obtained mainly using warm gas tracers (e.g. Halpha, [OII], [OIII]), which may be strongly affected by non-circular motions driven by inflows, outflow, and mergers.",The HUMBLE sample: galaxy dynamics at cosmic noon using ALMA observations of cold gas tracers
Golshan Ejlali,"Interstellar dust plays an important role in the formation of molecular gas and the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium. The spatial distribution of the mm-wavelength dust emission from galaxies is largely unexplored. The NIKA2 Guaranteed Time Project IMEGIN (Interpreting the Millimeter Emission of Galaxies with IRAM and NIKA2) has recently mapped the mm emission in the grand design spiral galaxy NGC6946. By subtracting the contributions from the free-free, synchrotron, and CO line emission, we map the distribution of the pure dust emission at 1.15mm and 2mm. Separating the arm/interarm regions, we find a dominant 2mm emission from interarms indicating the significant role of the general interstellar radiation field in heating the cold dust. Finally, we present maps of the dust mass, temperature, and emissivity index using the Bayesian MCMC modeling of the spectral energy distribution in NGC6946.",Dust Emission in Galaxies at Millimeter Wavelengths: Cooling of star forming regions in NGC6946
Helena Richie,"Large-scale computational modeling of galaxy evolution is challenging because many orders of magnitude in scale are physically relevant, from cosmological evolution on megaparsec (Mpc) scales to star formation occurring on parsec scales. Dust originates and evolves on the smallest of these scales, and its effects propagate throughout galaxies as it is transported, grown, and destroyed. Modeling these mechanisms can help us understand the many processes that the presence of dust regulates, such as star formation, galactic metal content, and more. Computational Hydrodynamics on paraLLel Architectures, or Cholla, is a hydrodynamics code that can be used to make extremely high resolution simulations of single galaxies. Thanks to its GPU-native nature, Cholla can simulate down to dx<5 pc at a fixed resolution across its entire simulation volume, making it the only code of its kind to fully capture the detailed structures of the interstellar medium (ISM) and galactic outflows simultaneously. Cholla has successfully simulated disk galaxies with star formation feedback-driven outflows, and shown how cool clouds can survive in these hot outflows by resolving the mixing layer between wind phases. Another aspect of this scenario that Cholla is well-positioned to shed light on is the survival of dust in these hot winds—although it originates in the late stages of stellar evolution in the ISM, dust is often observed in the circumgalactic media (CGMs) of galaxies. Could winds be responsible for transporting dust out of galaxies? The answer to this question has been unclear because of the high likelihood of dust destruction in hot gas, but it may be possible for cold clouds in winds to transport dust undisturbed. My work to develop and implement a self-consistent dust model in Cholla will give us new insight into the viability of this transport mechanism, and the conditions under which dust can survive in outflows.",The Dusty Universe -- Direct Simulation Of Dust On Galaxy Scales
Ikki Mitsuhashi,"Dust continuum morphologies of high redshift galaxies are essential for galaxy evolution as a tracer of obscured star formation. We report the dust size measurement of “typical” star-forming galaxies at z=4-6 as a part of the ALMA large program, CRISTAL. High-resolution and deep ALMA observations allow us to measure accurate dust continuum size of the less-dusty UV-selected galaxies at z=4-6 with an order of  magnitude fainter dust continuum fluxes (or FIR luminosities) than classical DSFGs. The measured dust continuum sizes are almost consistent with rest-frame UV sizes of these galaxies. The surface FIR densities are comparable with that of the extended components of the SMGs. These results suggest normal star-forming galaxies are forming their disks through their widespread star formation contrary to massive DSFGs, which show compact star formation in their central part. ",Resolved dust emission of UV-selected normal star-forming galaxies at z=4-6
Juan Diego Soler ,"We present a study of the filamentary structure in the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) emission at 21 cm using the observation at 16.2 arcminutes resolution in the HI4PI survey across the Galactic plane and at 40-arcseconds resolution in The HI/OH/Recombination-line (THOR) survey in the first Galactic quadrant. We found that the Milky Way’s disk regions beyond ten kpc and up to roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic center display HI filamentary structures predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane. However, we found that the HI filaments are mostly perpendicular or do not have preferred orientation with respect to the Galactic plane for regions at lower Galactocentric radii. We interpret these results as the imprint of supernova feedback in the inner Galaxy and Galactic rotation and shear in the outer Milky Way. We also studied the carbon monoxide (CO) emission observations obtained in The Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey. We found that the orientations of the filamentary structures traced by CO emission differed from those found in the HI emission. We consider this to indicate that the molecular structures do not simply inherit these properties from parental atomic clouds. Instead, they are shaped by local physical conditions, such as stellar feedback and magnetic fields.",The Galactic dynamics revealed by the filamentary structure in the atomic hydrogen emission toward the Milky Way’s disk
Mahsa Kohandel,"In the past decade, ALMA has been extraordinary in resolving spatially and spectrally the cold gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies at z>4 through FIR emission lines such as [CII] at 158\mu m. Analyzing [CII] line kinematics observables have revealed hints of the regular rotation in high-z galaxies and in some cases existence of surprisingly evolved systems (with substantial support from rotation) in the very early universe (when it had less than a Giga year). With JWST in operation, we will soon have complimentary information about the ionized ISM of early galaxies through nebular emission lines such as the Hα line. With a load of data coming from observations, a solid prediction from theory is needed more than ever to help interpret the data. In this talk, I will introduce the SERRA suite of cosmological galaxy simulations which are tailored to the Epoch of Reionization (z>6). In particular, I will present our results analyzing the synthetic hyperspectral datacubes for the far-infrared [CII] and nebular Hα emission lines for SERRA galaxies which is the first attempt to have predictions on the dynamical state of EoR galaxies that will be (are) probed by JWST (ALMA). The questions I will touch upon are: I) When do galaxies form their disk structure in cosmological simulations? II) If the early disks exist, what are their observable signatures in FIR and nebular emission lines? III) Are high-z disks very turbulent structures or they are supported by ordered motions?

Patrick Kamieneski,"In the past decade, submillimeter surveys have been employed to define samples of gravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z=1-4 (and beyond). These extreme objects (IR luminosities of 10^12 -10^14 L_sun) appear to form stars prodigiously at rates of 100 – 3000 M_sun/yr. While once thought to be entirely the product of major mergers, recent advances have revealed instead that a substantial number of these dusty starbursts show evidence for rotationally-supported molecular disks. Unlike local (ultra-)luminous IR galaxies—or (U)LIRGs—which form stars in compact nuclear regions, high-z DSFGs show evidence for widespread star formation in clumps distributed throughout the rotating disks. Here, I focus in particular on some of the most luminous such DSFGs, defined through PASSAGES: the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts. With ALMA’s 0.1-0.5” spatial resolution, combined with additional magnification provided by lensing, we can map the gas kinematics at sub-kpc scales that are usually only accessible in the local Universe, and even perform careful dynamical modeling of CO. This, in tandem with our view of active star formation from dust continuum from ALMA and the distribution of existing stars provided by Hubble, allows us to construct a picture of how stellar mass is built up over time in massive disk galaxies during the epoch of Cosmic Noon. Finally, JWST has already begun to revolutionize the study of DSFGs by revealing regions of galaxies that are heavily reddened and attenuated by dust. I will discuss how this sensitive near-IR imaging can be leveraged alongside ALMA to advance our understanding of disks in the early Universe.",Using gravitational lensing to resolve the rotating molecular disks of dusty starbursts at Cosmic Noon
Qi Li,"Dust plays a crucial role in the physics of galaxy evolution and shaping the interstellar radiation field. In this work, we investigate the origin and evolution of dust properties in local analogues, utilizing an on-the-fly dust evolution model combined with state of the art cosmological zooms. The simulations utilizes the SMUGGLE interstellar medium and stellar feedback model for the moving mesh code AREPO. The dust model evolves mass and size distributions of silicate and carbonaceous dust grains. Grains form in stellar ejecta, grow via the accretion of metals and are destroyed through sputtering in the hot halos and shocks of supernovae. The grain sizes are additionally reshaped via grain-grain collisions including shattering and coagulation. The simulations facilitate the study on the potential drivers that lead to a variety of extinction curves in galaxies today. We particularly focus on the origin of drastically different extinction features in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds as well as regions with different star formation activities within those galaxies.",The origin of various dust extinction curves in galaxies
Qingxiang Chen,"Physically resolved studies of gas and star formations in galaxies are essential but difficult at high redshift. In this talk, I will introduce our recent work on the continuum emission analysis for the galaxy SDSS J0901+1814, a strongly lensed main sequence star-forming galaxy at redshift 2.26. We obtain its continuum emission at 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz from VLA (L and S band). These observations are conducted at both A and B configurations for S-band and A configuration for the L-band, resulting in ~1’’ spatial resolution at both wavelengths. We thus successfully resolve the flux distribution for all three lensed arcs. With the help of previously observed VLA 35 GHz emission, we fit out a spectral index at the S-band of about -0.2. This leads to an unobscured star formation rate measurement of 142 M⦿/year, consistent with the prediction from the Hα+TIR combined tracer. Besides, we use the new tclean tool provided in CASA to furnish a pixel-by-pixel measurement on spectral indices. I will discuss the measurement in different regions with a Gaussian smoothing technique implemented on both the alpha and error maps. Together with the combination of SED fitting analysis, we conclude that J0901 is free-free emission dominated at S-band. At small scales, however, the enormous energy output is due to synchrotron emission from AGN activities, which steepens the spectral indices to about -2.",Continuum Emission and Spectral Index of the High Redshift Lensing Galaxy J0901 Through VLA S and L Band Observations
Ryota Ikeda,"Galaxy clusters in the present universe have a higher fraction of elliptical galaxies compared to low-density environments. To understand the origin of this environmental effect, observing an active phase of star formation in high-redshift clusters is thought to be effective. We present an ALMA study obtained from spatially resolved CO J=2–1 line (0.4”  resolution) and 870 μm continuum (0.2” resolution) observations of cluster galaxies in XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z = 1.46. Our sample comprises 17 CO emitters within ∼0.5 Mpc (0.6R200) from the cluster center. The effective radii of both CO J=2–1  line and 870 μm dust continuum emissions are robustly measured for nine galaxies by modeling the visibilities. We find that the CO J=2–1  line emission in all of the nine galaxies is more extended than the dust continuum emission by a factor of 2.8 ± 1.4. The spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation for our sample reveals that the central region (0 < r < Re,870μm) of galaxies tends to have a shorter gas depletion timescale, i.e. a higher star formation efficiency (SFE), compared to the extended region (Re,870μm < r < Re,CO). Overall, our result suggests that star formation activities are concentrated inside the extended gas reservoir, possibly resulting in the formation of a bulge structure. We also present the recent result of gas kinematics using CO J=2-1 line.

Detailed follow-up observations of such sources will help to illustrate the evolutionary path from primordial density fluctuations to galaxies like the Milky Way. To facilitate the most insightful and accurate science interpretation of JWST observations, it is essential to develop a robust understanding of the precise capabilities and limitations of the telescope for various applications. I present work on constraining the performance of JWST at resolving the kinematics of galaxies in the early universe, and on developing and optimizing modelling tools for the interpretation of JWST data. To do this, we perform kinematic analysis on realistic mock NIRSpec observations using simulated data, and compare the information from warm and cold gas tracers to understand the sensitivity required from JWST to detect gas outflows. Additionally, we test the ability of a classification method based on the morphology of the position-velocity diagram to identify galactic dynamic types as discs, mergers, and galaxies dominated by wind-driven non-circular motions.

Sian Phillips (2),"Understanding the structure, properties and dynamics of individual galaxies from the Epoch of Reionization provides insight into the physics of galaxy formation and evolution at early times. In particular, with resolved emission line studies we can investigate the contribution of mergers and smooth gas accretion to galaxy growth and determine which process dominates, as well as build an understanding of the self-regulation of star-formation through the identification of strong outflows.

Unlike some sources at these redshifts, we identify a weak velocity gradient (no strong evidence for rotation or mergers) and multiple structures that are offset both spatially and in velocity space from the main galaxy component. Such complex structure could indicate either strong outflows or the accretion of minor ‘clumps’ onto the galaxy, revealing a galaxy in the complex process of formation.

Antonino Milone,"The presence of more than one stellar population in globular clusters (GCs) is one of the most fascinating discoveries in the field of stellar populations. Yet, the phenomenon remains an enigma. To now, the best tool to investigate and constrain the properties of the different populations of stars is by means of the nicknamed ""Chromosome Maps"" diagram, which exploit UV multi-band photometry to maximise the separation of stellar populations on a plane mostly sensitive to light elements. I will present our latest observational results about the properties of the multiple stellar populations as read on the Chromosome Maps diagrams. These diagrams have revealed amazing features about the phenomenon, moving in fact towards a new definition of GC, which should no longer be considered as a mono-metallicity mono-Fe stellar system. With the launch of the JWST, however, we will move our focus to a different region of the spectrum, never explored for the investigation of the multiple stellar populations.

In this talk, I will present some of my recent works of modeling the formation, evolution, and disruption of clusters across cosmic time in cosmological simulations. We find that the formation efficiency of YMCs are strongly enhanced during major merger events, suggesting a promising link between the merger history of the host galaxies and origin of GCs.

Madeleine McKenzie,"In the context of hierarchical galaxy assembly, globular clusters and dwarf galaxies are indispensable probes of the formation of our Milky Way. M 22 is a curious stellar system with chemical abundances reminiscent of an accreted dwarf galaxy such as Omega Centauri, yet has disk-like kinematics suggesting a Milky Way origin. Unlike the vast majority of clusters, M 22 contains a population of stars enhanced in slow neutron-capture (S-)process elements. Although no universally accepted formation scenario exists for this system, our investigations suggest that this s-process element enhancement is due to pollution from low-mass AGB stars. Recently, large high-precision spectroscopic surveys have revealed the in-situ component of our Galaxy, dubbed Aurora. This component is said to be the precursor to the Milky Way disk. Further analysis has revealed that Aurora is enhanced in s-process elements compared to other chemical structures at similar metallicity. This provides a tantalising link between the original in-situ stars of the Milky Way and the formation of M 22. I will discuss how our recent high precision chemical abundance measurements suggest that M 22 may be coeval with Aurora, and what the formation mechanisms of this s-process population can tell us about the chemical evolution of our Galaxy before the establishment of the disk.

Minh Ngoc Le,"The initial conditions that give rise to Globular Clusters (GCs) are still mysterious. Significant progress has been made in the last decade: a clear correlation has been found between the total number (or mass) of GCs in a galaxy and the mass of its host dark matter halo, which appears to hold over many decades in halo mass and so provides an important constraint on models; meanwhile, detailed hydrodynamical models of GC populations in a cosmological context have shown that substantial fraction may have formed in the turbulent ISM of massive, gas-rich galaxies at 1 < z < 4. However, a subdominant population of primordial GCs may also have formed as ‘nuclear clusters’ in low-mass dark matter halos, before the epoch of reionization. If primordial clusters exist, their cosmic abundance may be a useful probe of earliest epoch of galaxy formation, and hence of cosmology (as first suggested by Peebles and Dicke in 1968). In this work, we apply parameterized models of primordial GC formation to Extended Press-Schechter merger trees, and attempt to constrain their allowed parameter space through statistical comparison to the observed relation between cluster number and halo mass. A novel feature of our work is a new version of the halo mass relation, derived by extrapolating the trend of cluster counts with stellar mass (based on a currently small sample of deep cluster counts for individual galaxies) to large galaxy group catalogues. We explore several straightforward models in CDM and WDM cosmogonies. We will report our work in progress on this approach, which can be extended to more complex GC formation scenarios in future.",Statistical constraints on primordial GC formation
Ricardo Schiavon (1),"We will present the first results of a pilot program undertaken with JWST/NIRSPEC to study the chemical composition of the old M31 disk.  Our goal is to obtain, for the first time, the abundances of Fe, C, N, and O for hundreds of M31 old disk giants, in order to constrain the history of star formation and mass assembly of the M31 disk, contrasting its properties with those of the Milky Way disk.   A key property of Galactic disk populations is the so-called “alpha bimodality”.  It consists of the existence of two populations with distinct values, at same metallicity, of the ratio between the abundances of alpha elements and iron, [alpha/Fe].  Theoretical predictions posing the alpha bi-modality as a consequence of general disk galaxy physics imply that it is a ubiquitous feature of disk galaxies.  Conversely, cosmological numerical simulations contend that the alpha-bimodality is linked with an intense star formation episode associated with a vigorous early accretion history, which would make the Milky Way an unusual galaxy, at the 2-sigma level.  By establishing whether the alpha-bimodality is present in the M31 disk, we hope to single-handedly test the hypothesis that the Milky Way is an unusual galaxy and place a fundamental constraint on the early evolution of its giant Local Group companion.  We will use a combination of  NIRCAM photometry and NIRSPEC spectroscopy to constrain the presence of an alpha-bimodality in one disk field located 1.5 scale lengths from the centre of M31.  The data are scheduled for collection on the first half of December 2022, and we expect to have first results ready for presentation by the time of this Symposium. ",Unearthing the fossilised Andromeda galaxy with JWST or Is the Milky Way rare?
Ricardo Schiavon (2),"Globular clusters are among the most intriguing objects in astrophysics. Albeit they are often used as tracers of early structure formation, quantitative models for their formation are only now beginning to solidify. Significant gaps in our understanding of these systems still exist—for instance, the ultimate fate of globular clusters (GC). We still do not entirely understand how GCs are destroyed or how efficiently, and as a result their contribution to the stellar mass budget of galaxies is poorly constrained. In the past decade, field stars with an abundance pattern characteristic of so-called second generation GC populations have been identified, whose existence has been proposed to result from GC disruption. The SDSS/APOGEE survey has made major progress through the detection of a large population of second generation GC stars in the Galactic halo field, estimating that the contribution by GC disruption to the halo stellar mass varies from a few percent at Rgc ~ 10 kpc to approximately ~25% within the inner 2 kpc of the Galactic centre. In this talk I will present the results of a thorough evaluation of the incidence of second generation GC stars in all components of the Milky Way, and its Local Group dwarf companions, based on the 17th data release of the APOGEE 2 survey.

Sang-Hyun Chun,"The globular clusters and their extended stellar halo are useful to understand their origin and dynamical evolution as well as the assembly history of the galaxy. However, the chemical properties of stars in tidal tails of globular clusters have been poorly studied so far. We can understand the role of globular clusters in structure formation of the Milky Way by comparing the chemical properties of extra-tidal stars of globular clusters and field stars. In this study, we search for tidal tail around globular cluster M92 using Gaia data and investigate the chemical properties of stars in its tidal tail using APOGEE data.  We find the tidal tail with a length of 6 degrees by applying a matched filter algorithm to the color-magnitude diagram of M92. We also apply the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to the APOGEE chemical data to select cluster member stars. We find that globular cluster member stars are well separated from the field stars in a 2-dimensional map from t-SNE. Among 82 identified cluster member stars, 12 stars are placed in the extended stellar halo and along the tidal tail of M92. Particularly, 7 extra-tidal stars show apparent Al-enhanced and Mg-depleted chemical features, which could indicate that these stars are ejected second-generation stars from M92. This result suggests that some stars in the Galactic halo originated from the tidal disruption of globular clusters. How the second generation stars of M92 are ejected is also very intriguing and needs further discussion.",Second generation stars in the tidal tail of globular cluster M92 from Gaia and APOGEE survey data
Andrew Cooper,"I will present simulations of the stellar halos of low-mass disk galaxies (ranging from the mass of the LMC to the mass of M33). These simulations combine the Galform semi-analytic model, the COCO cosmological N-body simulation and the STINGS particle tagging technique. These models provide a broader context for earlier studies, which have focused on more massive galaxies (Milky-Way analogues), and demonstrate how the well-known scatter between stellar mass and viral mass contributes to the diversity of stellar halo properties in stellar mass-selected samples. I will show comparisons to current low surface brightness observations of low-mass disk galaxies. I will then summarize predictions for surface brightness profiles and stellar populations in the outskirts of these galaxies and the potential use of those observables as probes of mass assembly history, with a view to upcoming datasets from Euclid, LSST and other surveys. I will briefly introduce the public release of particle data from our simulations.",The stellar halos of low-mass disk galaxies
Andrew Crombie Mason,"Dwarf galaxies account for a large fraction of the stellar mass in the universe, yet their histories of star formation (SF) are poorly constrained. This is largely due to the paucity of data on the chemical compositions of their constituent stars, with extant information being limited to relatively small samples from the Local Group Dwarfs. State of the art cosmological numerical simulations offer an excellent opportunity to make up for this limitation by providing statistically significant samples of realistic chemistry of stellar populations for galaxies in a range of masses and environments. A useful diagnostic of the SF history of a stellar system is the distribution of the stars in the [alpha/fe]-[fe/h] plane. It is often characterised by the presence of an [alpha/Fe] plateau at low metallicity, connected to a decreasing sequence at higher metallicity by a so-called “alpha-knee”. It is common belief that the metallicity of the alpha-knee is correlated with galaxy mass based on data for a handful of Milky Way and Andromeda satellites. In this talk I will present the results of an in-depth investigation of this claim based on the predictions by the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations. We analyse the knee metallicity-galaxy mass relation for both central and satellite galaxies spanning a broad stellar mass range at z=0. We find that EAGLE galaxies that do show an alpha-knee display a strong relation between total stellar mass and metallicity of the knee [Fe/H]_knee. We find that, unlike commonly proposed, alpha-knees are not caused simply by the onset of Type Ia supernovae. Rather, it is due to a combination of the latter and a strong decline in the star formation rate. Without the latter condition, galaxies never form a knee in the alpha-Fe plane. We also find that the simulations predict a very large scatter in the M* - [Fe/H]_knee relation. We explore the dependence of this scatter on important galactic parameters such as formation time and assembly history. This scatter is associated with the duration of the peak of the SF history. I will discuss the implication of our results for our understanding of dwarf galaxy formation.",The Anatomy of the Knee: the Origin of the Diverse alpha-Element Abundance Patterns of Galaxies in the EAGLE Simulations
Andrew Wetzel,"I will present predictions from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations for the formation history of the Local Group in a cosmological context. First, I will discuss the formation history of the MW and M31 galaxies, including when the main progenitor of the MW/M31 likely formed and how this depends on them being in the Local Group paired environment. Then, I will discuss the formation and settling of their stellar and gaseous disks, including the relevant importance of disk setting versus post-formation heating for determining the observable relation between stellar kinematics and stellar age today. Finally, I will discuss the formation histories of the satellite galaxies in these simulations, showing that the current satellite population is a highly incomplete census of the progenitor population that formed the Local Group, and I will quantify how well the stellar populations of surviving low-mass galaxies provide fossil records of the overall galaxy population at z > 6, to inform the use of galactic archeology in probing the epoch of reionization.",Simulating the formation of the Milky Way and the Local Group
Andrey Kravtsov,"I will present a simple model for evolution of dwarf galaxies, which can reproduce a remarkably broad range of observed properties of dwarf galaxies over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass. In particular, we show that the model can simultaneously match observational constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, as well as observed relations between stellar mass and gas phase and stellar metallicities, gas mass, size, and star formation rate, as well as general form and diversity of star formation histories of observed dwarf galaxies. We use the model to forward model population of the Milky Way (MW) satellites down to the faintest luminosities probed by observations (M_V~0) and properly taking into account observational selection effects, effects of disk disruption and effects of LMC. We show that 1) observed luminosity function (LF) favors early reionization (z_rei~8) of the local volume, 2) model can reproduce radial distribution of the MW satellites without use of orphans, 3) analyses of a sample of MW-sized halos shows that observed planar distribution of the Milky Way satellites and correlation of their orbital poles is somewhat unusual, but is statistically consistent with LCDM.

Anirudh Chiti,"We present the detailed chemical abundances of stars in the outskirts (out to ~9 half-light radii) of the Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The Milky Way’s UFDs are “relic” galaxies (~13 Gyr old) from the early universe, making their stars unique probes of the first stages of galactic and chemical evolution in a simple, self-contained environment. Previous spectroscopic studies had largely been limited to stars within the core of these galaxies (~2 half-light radii) due to the sparseness of their distant stars. This work presents the first detailed abundances of a population of stars outside a UFD’s core region (~4 half-light radii) that appear to be bound to the galaxy. The distant stars are, on average, more metal-poor than the central population, affirming Tucana II to be the most metal-poor known UFD (<[Fe/H]> ~ -2.85). This difference between inner and outer stars suggests Tucana II, and perhaps other ultra-faints, plausibly were influenced by early, strong feedback or a galactic merger. In particular, the alpha-element abundances in Tucana II indicate some delayed chemical evolution, consistent with Tucana II being formed by an early merger of two first galaxies that triggered star formation. Such distant stars also imply that Tucana II harbors a massive, spatially extended dark matter halo. Collectively, these results suggest that key factors in understanding the early evolution of relic dwarf galaxies lie in their outskirts and were missed by previous observations. We demonstrate that detailed studies of such stars in the halos of relic galaxies are now possible.",Detailed chemical abundances of stars in the extended halo of an ancient dwarf galaxy
Chung-Wen Wang,"Wide-area deep imaging surveys have discovered large numbers of extremely low surface brightness dwarf galaxies, which present interesting challenges to galaxy formation theory and, potentially, new constraints on the nature of the dark matter. In this work, we will discuss one as-yet unexplored formation mechanism that may account for a fraction of low surface brightness galaxies. We call this the `ghost galaxy' scenario. In this scenario, inefficient radiative cooling prevents star formation in the dominant dark matter potential of low mass halos, such that almost all their stellar mass is acquired through mergers. Systems formed in this way would appear as 'ghostly' isolated stellar halos  with no central galaxy. We use merger trees based on the Extended Press-Schechter formalism and the CoCo cosmological N-body simulation to demonstrate that mass assembly histories of this kind do occur for low-mass halos in lambda CDM. They are most probable in isolated halos of present-day mass 4 x 10^9 M_sun, occurring for 5 per cent of all halos of that mass. The stellar masses of the star-forming progenitors in these systems are highly uncertain, but abundance-matching arguments imply a bimodal present-day mass function having a brighter population. We will discuss the sensitivity of this result to assumptions about cosmic reionization and the dark matter particle mass.

Damir Gasymov,"The process of growing galactic discs is still not fully understood. In the majority of disk galaxies the gas and stars are located in the same plane and rotate in the same direction. However there are kinematically peculiar galaxies hosting two counter-rotating stellar discs. Their origin is believed to be the result of a past event of accretion of gas followed by star formation.By studying such galaxies we will be able to learn how much material, when, and how might have fallen onto the progenitor galaxy. Using publicly available data of the SDSS MaNGA DR17 survey we identified a sample of 56 counter-rotating galaxies in the MaNGA IFU survey and initiated a follow-up observational campaign at 6-m BTA telescope aiming to determine the stellar population properties of both stellar discs. Our preliminary results suggest the dichotomy of the sample of counter-rotating galaxies. We found that most massive galaxies have extended counter-rotating disks whose contribution to luminosity is higher than in the less massive galaxies suggestive of different evolutionary paths.",Study of galaxies with stellar counter-rotation phenomenon
Emily Wisnioski,"Galaxy evolution is an inherently messy processes to disentangle. To achieve a holistic understanding we need to combine our observations and models to ask: how does the Milky Way's evolutional path fit within modern observations of the high-z universe?  Kinematics and structural studies have revealed that the majority of 'normal' star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon host thick disk-like structure and a turbulent gas-rich interstellar medium while new CII observations reveal possibly cold disks at cosmic dawn. Chemical studies reveal that the resolved abundance patterns of disks are also evolving with radial gradients being subdominant at early times. How does this relate to the state-of-the art models of the MW's past? I will present results that show how combining new analytic models (e.g. Sharda et al. 2021 and Leaman et al. 2022) with  high redshift surveys of molecular and ionised gas and local galactic/extragalactic archeology studies can provide insight to the evolutionary history of local galaxies including the Milky Way. I will discuss observational results within the framework of theoretical models for the formation of the local stellar age-velocity dispersion relation, the size-scale height relation, and history of metallicity gradients in local group galaxies.",Connecting Epochs:  how the chemo-dynamical evolution of disks over cosmic time is imprinted on local galaxies
Genta Sato,"It is observationally known that many satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) distribute along a large-scaled plane. This structure is called as Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) (e.g., Pawlowski et al. 2012). The reason the satellites form two-dimensional structure has not been solved yet. Additionally, it is also known that other galaxies (e.g., Andromeda) have the same large planar structure in their satellites. Therefore, I expect that the mechanism to generate VPOS comes from a general galaxy physics, not from the MW's unique property. I carried out numerical calculation to search the condition reproducing the stable orbits of particles consistent with the actual VPOS, in terms of the figure rotation of the MW' halo. I found that a stable orbital plane with presession around the rotating axis appears within a rotating potential model.",The occurrence and evolution of the planer structure in Milky Way's satellite galaxies
Gerhard Hensler,"It is well accepted that the majority of massive galaxies has suffered at least one major merger event during their lifetime independent whether the remnant becomes a gas-rich disk galaxy or a red and dead elliptical. Since both merging galaxies combine their satellite systems and additionally produce new star clusters and dwarf galaxies in their gaseous tidal tails (TDGs for the latter), the motions of these sub-components and their resistence against tidal disruption depend on the accumulated Dark Matter (DM) halo. We have therefore analyzed the radial DM density distribution of two merging galaxies from the merger simulation by Yang et al. (2014) in a temporal sequence after the merger event and have compared the snapshots with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profle of a relaxed halo which is generally assumed for massive galaxy halos. As expected, but nowhere shown, the relaxation of the DM halo takes much longer than the numerical simulation runs and whitness the merger event even after 6.5 Gyrs by an anisotropic DM distribution, becoming flat in the orbital plane of the merging galaxies, while the vertical DM stratification survives close to NFW. The consequences are obvious. Former satellites are affected by the anisotropic DM distribution by two measures: i) the gravitational binding in the orbital plane decreases, facilitating those satellites on orbits close to the plane to escape from the merger, while satellites on polar orbits become more closely bound. This flattening of the DM's gravity also affects newly born TDGs, so that numerical simulations of satellites and TDGs fail when implying a spherical static NFW profile. ii) The tidal force of the merger remnant acts differently on satellites.",Is the Dark-Matter Distribution of Merger Remnants still spherical?

Hesti Wulandari,"Due to their low mass, dwarf galaxies are highly vulnerable to internal and external disturbances, which alter the evolution of the galaxy. The disturbances cause baryonic matter to leave the system more easily; therefore, dwarf galaxies are expected to be more dominant in dark matter than normal galaxies. However, recent observations discovered some dark matter deficient dwarf galaxies. This motivates studies to investigate other dwarf galaxies and look for possible explanations for the deficiency. The aim our work is to examine dwarf galaxies in the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves) and LITTLE THINGS (Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey) catalogs, to identify if any of them are dark matter deficient, and to explore some possible causes. For this identification, EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) simulation galaxies are used, and it is assumed that their conditions describe the expected conditions for the observed galaxies. Three dark matter deficient galaxies, i.e., IC 1613, DDO 50, and UGC 7125 are identified as outliers in the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, having galaxy formation efficiency higher than 20% and different rotation curves compared to the simulated galaxies. However, the dark matter deficiency in UGC 7125 is not conclusive due to the distance uncertainty. On the contrary, the available literature for IC 1613 and DDO 50 do not show any sign that the dark matter deficiency in the two galaxies is due to distance uncertainties. The uncertainty in the inclination of IC 1613 may change the conclusion of the dark matter deficiency, but that is not the case for DDO 50 and UGC 7125. Based on the examination of the tidal radii of the siblings, no potential of stripping is indicated in the three galaxies. However, literature show an indication of gas disturbance in DDO 50 through ram pressure stripping by the hot gas in the galaxy cluster, and that the HI disk of UGC 7125 warps.",Identification of dark matter deficient dwarf galaxies in SPARC and LITTLE THINGS
Jaeweon Lee,"We numerically make a comparison between the fuzzy dark matter model and  the cold dark matter model, focusing on formations of satellite galaxy planes around massive galaxies.

Janvi Madhani,"There has been a long standing conflict between observations of planes of dwarf satellites around local galaxies and numerical simulations of similar galaxies. Observations find planes of satellites around the Milky Way, Andromeda, Centaurus A and possibly several other local galaxies. Numerical simulations find that planes are rare, present in less than 2% of Milky Way-type systems, or are spurious and short-lived. This discrepancy has been interpreted as a challenge to our accepted cosmology, namely the Lambda CDM paradigm. We present results that show that this conflict can be resolved if one simulates a larger volume, while forcing small-scale resolution across it, to better capture inflow along cosmic filaments. We use the New Horizon simulation and find that ~30% of Milky Way-type systems have satellite planes, therefore, solving this conflict.  We also discuss the likely origins of these planes and a new window into the dynamics of the Local Universe they may provide.",Conflict Solved: Satellite Planes Found in Numerical Simulations
Jesse van de Sande,"Due to the complexity of internal and external processes acting on disk galaxies, many outstanding questions regarding their evolution remain. Our Milky Way provides an unparalleled view of disk evolution but building a comprehensive framework from a single object is unrealistic. In this talk I will present the GECKOS survey (Generalising Edge-on galaxies and their Chemical bimodalities, Kinematics, and Outflows out to Solar environments), a new ESO VLT/MUSE large program. The main aim of GECKOS is to reveal the variation in key physical processes of disk formation by connecting Galactic Archaeology with JWST studies of turbulent star-forming disks in the early Universe. Edge-on galaxies are ideal for this task: they allow us to disentangle the assembly history imprinted in thick disks and provide the greatest insights into outflows. The GECKOS sample of 35 nearby, edge-on disk galaxies is designed to determine the assembly histories and properties of galaxies across a large range of SFRs, B/T ratios, and boxy and non-boxy bulges. At this meeting, I will present the survey’s first few months of IFS data, with 2D measurements of stellar abundance, age, and kinematics, as well as ionised gas metallicities, ionisation parameters, and outflow kinematics; all core ingredients for chemical evolution models.  With these data, we aim to extend Galactic methods to the wider galaxy population, reaping the benefits of detailed Milky Way studies, while probing the diverse mechanisms of galaxy evolution.

I will explain how our analysis techniques can be used for upcoming imging, including from LSST, Euclid, or JWST. ",Uncovering galaxy history through deep imaging
Jorge Moreno,"The standard cold dark matter plus cosmological constant model predicts that galaxies form within dark-matter haloes, and that dwarf galaxies are more dark-matter dominated than massive ones. The unexpected discovery of two low-mass galaxies lacking dark matter immediately provoked concerns about the standard cosmology and ignited explorations of alternatives, including self-interacting dark matter and modified gravity. Apprehension grew after several cosmological simulations using the conventional model failed to form adequate numerical analogues with comparable internal characteristics. In this talk I will show that the standard paradigm naturally produces galaxies lacking dark matter with internal characteristics in agreement with observations. Using FIREbox, a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation based on the `Feedback In Realistic Environments' (FIRE) model, and a meticulous galaxy-identification technique, we find that extreme close encounters with massive neighbours can be responsible for this. We predict that ~30% of massive central galaxies (with at least 1e11 solar masses in stars) harbour at least one dark-matter-deficient satellite (with 1e8–1e9 solar masses in stars). This distinctive class of galaxies provides an additional layer in our understanding of the role of interactions and tidal stripping in shaping galactic properties. Future observations surveying galaxies in the aforementioned regime, with facilities like the Rubin and JWST, will provide a crucial test of this scenario. If time allows, I will also speak of future plans to conduct ultra-high resolution zooms capable of probing the formation and nature of globular clusters in these galaxies.

Kaley Brauer,"In the age of Gaia, we are gaining a better understanding of the major mergers experienced by the Milky Way throughout its formation, such as the Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia events. The low mass end of the Milky Way's assembly history is still poorly understood, however. The smallest dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way, the ultra faint dwarfs (UFDs), were among the first galaxies in the Universe and could provide important insight into early galaxy formation and chemical enrichment. Currently, though, we lack ways to identify stars which accreted from UFDs. By utilizing the Caterpillar simulation suite, a suite of 35 Milky Way-mass galaxies forming, we find that chemical tagging with r-process elements and clustering in kinematic phase space can help us identify stars which accreted together from these dwarf galaxies. We are expanding on this work with highly-resolved hydrodynamic simulations of the earliest dwarf galaxies to quantify the low-mass end of the Milky Way assembly history. Identifying stars from UFDs that still exist in the Local Group is particularly vital because even JWST cannot directly observe these low-mass high-redshift galaxies.","The Smallest, Earliest Galaxies and their Contributions to the Milky Way"

Ling Zhu,"In the last decade, IFU observations have provided kinematical, age, and metallicity maps of thousands of nearby galaxies. By applying a novel population-orbit superposition method to the IFU data, we have been able to obtain a galaxy’s internal stellar orbit distribution, as well as the age and metallicity of different orbital structures. We have applied this method to a few hundreds of CALIFA, MaNGA and Fornax 3D (observed by MUSE/VLT) galaxies, and the results lead to direct comparisons of galaxy structures with simulations systematically.  For galaxies in field, we find that the stellar orbit distribution of Illustris TNG50 galaxies matches that of the CALIFA galaxies remarkable well, quantitatively in the fractions of dynamical cold/hot orbits as a function of galaxy mass in the range of 10^9.5 -10^12 Msun. For galaxies in the Fornax cluster, we find that the recent infallers have similar stellar orbit distribution to the field galaxies, while ancient infallers have much lower fractions of dynamically cold orbits for galaxies in all mass ranges, this trend is also found similarly in TNG50 cluster galaxies. With this direct comparisons and remarkable agreements between observations and simulations, the stellar orbit distribution thus provides us a clean interface for quantitatively investigating the origin of galactic structures from simulations.

Maryam Khademi,"To investigate the dynamical nature of the kinematic asymmetry in the isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxy W LM in the Local Group, we first examine whether an m = 1 perturbation in the halo potential could be a mechanism creating such kinematical asymmetry. By fitting a theoretical rotational velocity associated with an m = 1 perturbation in the halo potential model to the observed data, we show that such a lopsided halo potential model can explain the asymmetry in the kinematic data reasonably well. In addition, we study the kinematical classification of the velocity field of WLM with various methods, and based on a kinemetry analysis, we find that it is possible for WLM to lie in the transition region, where the disk and merger coexist. Thus, a merger may indeed be one of the possible origins of the dark matter halo lopsidedness for this isolated galaxy.",kinematic asymmetry in the dwarf irregular galaxy W LM and a perturbed halo potential 
Matthew Orkney,"Galaxies in the LCDM paradigm form through the hierarchical assembly and merging of dark matter halos. There is increasing evidence that the Milky Way has itself undergone a turbulent past, with stellar populations in chemo-dynamical space indicative of high-ratio mass mergers. The most significant of these has become known as the Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE). Other populations identified in action-space have been proposed as signatures of yet more historic merger events, painting a picture of a rich and complex assembly history. The Auriga project consists of thirty cosmological-zoom simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, produced with the AREPO code. A third of these simulations have already been shown to host features analogous to the GSE. In this talk, I investigate the diversity of GSE analogues in the Auriga simulation suite, focusing on their kinematics and chemical properties both pre- and post-infall. I predict signals of high-redshift accretions which could discern major merger events even when chemo-dynamical analyses fall short. Then, I explore the diversity and luminosity functions of the satellite populations associated with these merging galaxies. Some satellites may appear as independent merger events, suggesting that distinct populations of stellar debris could be related to the same progenitor.

Mochammad Dafa Wardana,"The mass-anisotropy degeneracy is still one of the main issues in estimating the dark matter distribution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, especially for the commonly used second-order Jeans analysis. We study the extension of spherical Jeans modeling by incorporating the fourth-order velocity moments under the assumption of dynamical equilibrium and a constant velocity anisotropy. The inclusion of fourth-order velocity moments allows stars’ l.o.s velocity distribution, which is sensitive to the value of the velocity anisotropy parameter, to be flexible, covering thin-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions, that is inaccessible if only second-order moments are used. We test our stellar dynamical modeling using mock data that resembles Draco dSph with either central NFW cusp or Burkert core and isotropic velocity anisotropy. Using 500 sample stars, our simulations show that incorporating fourth-order velocity moments improves the results compared to when only second-order moments are used. Typically, the velocity anisotropy is constrained two times better, while it is ~50% improvement for the constraint of the inner dark matter density slope with both parameters being recovered within 1σ uncertainties.",Constraints on dark matter distribution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies based on the 4th-order Jeans analysis
Nicolas Garavito Camargo,"The vast multidimensional data observed in the Local Group (LG) provide us with the unique opportunity of comparing the properties of the LG with their simulated analogs in cosmological simulations. In such a comparison it has been found that the observed kinematic properties of satellite galaxies in the LG are very unusual when compared to cosmological simulations. In both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, satellite galaxies are found to be distributed and moving in flattened co-rotating systems. A configuration that is only found in 0.3-3% of the simulated galaxies. Such disagreement is known as the planes of satellites problem. More intriguing is that the disagreement is persistent even in different dark matter models and unlike other 'small-scale problems' it is not sensitive to the inclusion of baryonic processes in the simulations. In this talk, I would provide evidence of how a natural explanation of the observed co-rotation patterns are associated with the out-of-equilibrium state of the galaxy.  Recent missions and surveys, such as Gaia, have revealed that the Milky Way galaxy is not in dynamical equilibrium. The barycenter of the galaxy is moving due to the ongoing interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Latte hydrodynamical high-resolution zoom-in simulation of MW-like galaxies  A massive satellite moves the reference frame of the inner halo with respect to the outer halo. Resulting in some cases in apparent co-rotation motions of the outer halo when observed from the disk of the galaxies. I'll show how the orbital poles distribution of outer halo objects is strongly affected during the pericenter passages. I will further discuss what properties of the mergers, mass ratios, pericenter passages, and eccentricities, would be needed to reproduce the observational co-rotations pattern observed in the Milky Way and M31. These results provide new insight into how the observed co-ration patterns can inform us about the out-of-equilibrium stare of the galaxy. Which is a natural explanation that does not depend on the nature of the Dark Matter particle and in baryonic processes. These results also highlight the importance of taking into account the dynamic state of the LG when comparing it with LG analogs in cosmological simulations.

Nondh Panithanpaisal,"Recent studies have suggested that the Milky Way (MW)'s Dark Matter (DM) halo may be significantly tilted with respect to its central stellar disk, a feature that might be linked to its formation history. In this work, we demonstrate a method of constraining the orientation of the minor axis of the DM halo that is complementary to other traditional techniques, such as orbit fitting. We first test the method using a simulated tidal stream evolving in a realistic environment inside an MW-mass host from the FIRE cosmological simulation, showing that the theoretical description of a stream in the action-angle-frequency formalism still holds for a realistic dwarf galaxy stream in a cosmological potential. Utilizing the slopes of the line in angle and frequency space, we show that the correct rotation frame yields a minimal slope difference, allowing us to put a constraint on the minor axis location. Finally, we apply this method to the Sagittarius stream's leading arm. We report that the MW's DM halo is oblate with the flattening parameter in the potential $q\sim0.7-0.9$ and the minor axis pointing toward $(\ell,b) = (41.8\degree,48.1\degree)$. Our constraint on the minor axis location is weak and disagrees with the estimates from other works; we argue that the inconsistency can be attributed in part to the observational uncertainties and in part to the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Piyush Sharda (1),"The characteristic mass that sets the peak of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is closely linked to the thermodynamic behaviour of interstellar gas, which controls how gas fragments as it collapses under gravity. As the Universe has grown in metal abundance over cosmic time, this thermodynamic behaviour has evolved from a primordial regime dominated by the competition between compressional heating and molecular hydrogen cooling to a modern regime where the dominant process in dense gas is protostellar radiation feedback, transmitted to the gas by dust–gas collisions. We study the gas thermodynamics in collapsing dusty molecular clouds at a wide range of metallicities, from primordial-like to super-Solar like, in different ISM conditions. We show the transition from the primordial regime to the modern regime begins at metallicity Z ∼ 0.0001 Z, passes through an intermediate stage where metal line cooling is dominant, and then transitions to the modern dust- and feedback-dominated regime at Z ∼ 0.05 Z. This transition is accompanied by a dramatic change in the characteristic stellar mass, from ∼50Msun at Z ∼ 10−6 Z to ∼0.3Msun once radiation feedback begins to dominate, which marks the appearance of the bottom-heavy Milky Way IMF. The exact transition from top- to bottom-heavy IMF occurs at intermediate metallicities, and is sensitive to the adopted abundances of elements like C and O, which observations of both metal-poor stars and H II regions in metal-poor dwarf galaxies show is non-Solar-scaled. Our work brings together the stellar and galaxy communities by revealing the impact of the IMF on our understanding of the metal-poor Universe.",When did the IMF become bottom-heavy?
Piyush Sharda (2),"Using a new semi-analytic model developed from first principles, we study the relative importance of the four major physical processes that impact the evolution of galactic discs - gas accretion from the cosmic web, feedback due to star formation and supernovae, gas transport due to gravitational instabilities and torques, and galactic outflows, on the spatially-resolved gas-phase metal distribution in galaxies. Crucially and in contrast with earlier work, we include a comprehensive treatment of these processes by including their effects for the mass, energy as well as metal budget of galactic discs. We show that in order to simultaneously explain trends in ISM metallicities (the mass-metallicity relation and the mass-metallicity gradient relation) at z = 0, feedback and accretion must dominate over transport, which also explains the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and trends in gas velocity dispersions with star formation rates. At high redshifts, the role of transport becomes dominant over feedback in setting the ISM metal distribution and metallicity gradients. Outflows play a significant role in shaping the metallicity gradients in low mass galaxies at all redshifts, but massive galaxies show shallower gradients regardless of the metal enrichment of outflows. Upcoming JWST data of high-redshift galaxies will provide a crucial benchmark against which models likes ours can be tested, in turn providing critical constraints on metallicities of galactic winds and the role of accretion and feedback in driving turbulence in galactic discs.

Pratik Gandhi,"A key open question about the Epoch of Reionisation is the shape of the galaxy Ultraviolet Luminosity Function (UVLF) at the faint end. Even deep-field HST and JWST lensing surveys likely do not push deep enough to directly observe the faintest galaxies at z > 6, so a ""near-far"" approach provides an alternative probe. This technique uses the stellar fossil record (star formation histories) of Local Group dwarf galaxies to measure the faint end of the high-redshift UVLF. Here, we use the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations to test key remaining uncertainties in this near-far method that might bias inferences of the UVLF at z > 6. We model the fraction of low-mass galaxies in the proto-Local Group at z > 6 that survive to z = 0 and the number of mergers or disruptions they undergo. We explore how this survival fraction depends on dwarf galaxy mass and distance from the Milky Way. We also quantify how resolved stellar photometry by JWST out to farther distances in the Local Group could improve our measurement of the high-redshift UVLF as compared to existing HST observations. Ultimately, we characterise the fidelity of the near-far technique in using Local Group dwarfs to infer the faint end of the high-redshift galaxy UVLF.",Characterising the near-far probe of reionisation and evolution of Local Group low-mass galaxies using the FIRE simulations 
Qianhui Chen,"Understanding the evolution of spiral arms and their impacts on star formation from high redshift to present day is a crucial topic in the study of disk galaxy formation. Prior works studying the azimuthal distribution of interstellar medium (ISM) and their connection with spiral arms in several local and nearby galaxies reveal the importance of moving beyond simple radial gradients to connect the resolved ISM with global galactic properties and structures. Our work provides new constraints on the influence of spiral arms on star formation and the gas-phase metal abundance enhancement with unprecedented spatially resolved IFU data at intermediate redshift (z~0.3) from the MAGPI survey. In our pilot study, we find that the 2D distribution of D4000 and gas-phase metallicity indicate younger stellar age and higher gas-phase metallicity in spiral arms. We find a higher star forming rate (SFR) in spiral arms and decreasing SFR with further distance to the arms. We observe the asymmetric distributions of ISM properties in the downstream and upstream, possibly resulting from the difference in the mixing strength of spiral arms which can be traced by upcoming comparison with simulations. With further analysis of more MAGPI galaxies and a combined study of observations on nearby spiral galaxies at z~0, our work gives a glimpse of the long-term effects of spiral arms on the evolution of disk galaxies and advances the development of spiral theories.",Azimuthal Variations of ISM properties in Spiral Galaxies at z~0.3 with MAGPI

Sena Matsui,"The Local Group is a group of galaxies including the Milky Way Galaxy. Most of the members are dwarf galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are considered to have evolved through a number of internal mechanisms and external processes. For example, internal mechanisms include star formation, stellar feedback from supernova explosions, and galactic winds. External processes include tidal effects and the influence of star formation by nearby massive galaxies. The main targets of this study are dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). They are a class of galaxies with the lowest luminosities completely devoid of interstellar gas. Previous studies have suggested that the lack of interstellar gas is due in particular to the fact that some or most of the interstellar gas has been blown away by galactic winds in the past. Galactic winds are phenomena in which gas is partially or entirely blown away/out of a galaxy when a large number of supernova explosions occur in a short period of time. In this study, the timing of the onset of the galactic wind is calculated from multiple approaches using observed data, compared with the star formation history, and discussed. The results show that galactic winds blew away/out in many dwarf galaxies, and that star formation was temporarily or almost completely stopped. However, there were some dwarf galaxies for which no galactic wind was supposed to have blown, depending on the assumed conditions. In addition, a comparison with several galactic wind models and the relationship with the tidal effects due to the Milky Way gravitational potential will be discussed.",Estimating the onset timing of galactic winds and galaxy evolution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group
Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez,"We use the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to investigate the stellar specific angular momenta (j*) of ~12,000 central galaxies at z = 0 in a full cosmological context, with stellar masses (M*) ranging from 10^9 to 10^12 Msun. We find that the j*-M* relations for early-type and late-type galaxies in IllustrisTNG are in good overall agreement with observations, and that these galaxy types typically 'retain' ~10-20 and ~50-60 per cent of their host haloes' specific angular momenta, respectively, with some dependence on the methodology used to measure galaxy morphology. We present results for kinematic as well as visual-like morphological measurements of the simulated galaxies. Next, we explore the scatter in the j*-M* relation with respect to the spin of the dark matter halo and the mass of the supermassive black hole (BH) at the galactic centre. We find that galaxies residing in faster spinning haloes, as well as those hosting less massive BHs, tend to have a higher specific angular momentum. We also find that, at fixed galaxy or halo mass, halo spin and BH mass are anticorrelated with each other, probably as a consequence of more efficient gas flow towards the galactic centre in slowly rotating systems. Finally, we show that halo spin plays an important role in determining galaxy sizes - larger discs form at the centres of faster rotating haloes - although the trend breaks down for massive galaxies with M* > 10^11 Msun, roughly the mass scale at which a galaxy's stellar mass becomes dominated by accreted stars.","Galactic angular momentum in the IllustrisTNG simulation: Connection to morphology, halo spin, and black hole mass"
Yuka Kaneda (1),"In the hierarchical clustering scenario based on the \Lambda-CDM model, small scale dark matter haloes play a crucial role in building up the larger structures via merging processes. In addition, it is known that dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way are ideal sites to study the nature of dark matter since they are dark-matter-dominated systems. Based on the ultra-high resolution cosmological N-body simulation, Phi-4096 by Ishiyama et al. (2021), we investigate the evolution of satellite dark matter haloes associated with Milky-Way-sized dark matter haloes. In this study, we show that the evolutionary tracks of simulated small scale dark haloes on the V_{max}-r_{max} plane, where V_{max} is the maximum circular velocity and r_{max} is that radius, are different from that of the large scale haloes because of the tidal effects. We then propose a new fitting function for the c-M relation, which is the relationship between the c_{200}, a parameter representing the concentration of the mass distribution of NFW haloes and the virial mass M_{200}, for the mass scale of dwarf galaxies.  Furthermore, the origin of the scaling relation, the universality of the DM haloes in observations, is still an open question and should be investigated. We compare the c-M relation derived from the simulation with the observations. This analysis is performed on the c_{200}-M_{200} plane, the ρ_s-r_s plane, and the r_{max}-V_{max} plane. The results show that the theoretical prediction nicely reproduce the observed properties of haloes ranging from dwarf galaxies to clusters of galaxies. Finally, some empirical scaling laws such as the Burkert relation (Burkert 1995), the Strigari relation (Strigari et al. 2008), and the \mu_{0D} relation (Kormendy & Freeman 2016) are compared with the results of the simulation and shown to be consistent with the theoretical prediction of the \Lambda-CDM model.",The Evolution and Scaling Relations of Dark Matter Haloes
Yuka Kaneda (2),"The standard Λ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model gives a remarkable description of the structure formation of the universe on large scale. However, on smaller scales including the dark matter (DM) haloes of galaxies and dwarf galaxies, there have been some issues which have been the subject of controversy for a long period of time. One of them is the cusp–core problem, a disagreement between the theoretically predicted central density distribution of dark matter halo and the observed one. Besides, some interesting universal correlations between the properties of DM haloes, which are called ‘scaling relations’, have been found especially around low-mass galaxies. Thus far, the origin of these relations remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the origin of the empirical scaling relations in relation to the cusp-core problem. First, we present the comparison between the observations and the concentration-mass relation (c-M relation), which is a prediction for the universal properties of the DM haloes given by cosmological N-body simulations, on c_{200}-M_{200} plane, \rho_s-r_s plane, and r_{max}-V_{max} plane. Then, assuming the scenario that DM haloes are formed primarily with central cusps and then some dynamical processes remove DM from the central region, we reverted the cored profile to the cusp profile. In the reversion, some appropriate conditions are imposed about how the transition should occur, and detailed physical processes are not considered here. Reverted scaling relations remarkably agree with the c-M relation, suggesting that the c-M relation is the origin of the scaling relations and supporting the description that CDM produces a cusp in the centre of a halo and some dynamical process alters it to core.

Zefeng Li,"Resolved spectroscopy provides a unique window to explore heavy element (metal) enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM) of local galaxies. Next-generation methodologies are needed to make full use of the spatial information now available. Analytic models predict that the two-point correlation function of galaxy metal fields are based on metal injection-diffusion processes. We, for the first time, test a diffusion model on a large samples of spatially-resolved nearby galaxies and prove that it can be used as a powerful tool in the IFU era given the consistency between the model and the data. Parametric fitting of the two-point correlation functions of the nearby galaxies shows that the characteristic ISM diffusion length scales cover a wide range, which could point to the role of outflows in redistributing metals. To explore the importance of metal diffusion over cosmic time, I will present a new exploration on how the correlation length of metal fields of galaxies in the Auriga simulation evolve over time and what imprint, if any, they leave on present day galaxies.",Spatial metallicity Correlations in Galaxies

However, the Milky Way is only one galaxy, and it is crucial to link the galactic and extragalactic research to understand the formation and evolution of disk galaxies. Currently, one challenge is that the galactic and extragalactic observations are not in the same data format. In this work, we present a novel approach to generating the mock IFS data cube of the Milky Way by making use of the SSP spectral libraries and E-Galaxia. This tool can be used to compare the Milky Way with external disk galaxies directly, to look for signatures of formation processes in the detailed chemo-dynamical structure of disks, such as their velocity dispersion profiles, the radial and vertical age gradients and the mass fraction of the [α/Fe]-rich versus [α/Fe]-poor populations.

Zixian Wang Purmortal (2),"We present a novel approach to deriving stellar labels for stars observed in MUSE fields making use of data-driven machine learning methods. Taking advantage of the comparable spectral properties (resolution and wavelength coverage) of the LAMOST and MUSE instruments, we adopt the data-driven Payne (DD-Payne) model used on LAMOST observations and apply it to stars observed in MUSE fields. Remarkably, in spite of instrumental differences, according to the cross-validation of 27 LAMOST- MUSE common stars, we are able to determine stellar labels with precision better than 75K in Teff, 0.15 dex in log g, and 0.1 dex in abundances of [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [C/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] for current MUSE observations over a parameter range of 3800 < Teff < 7000 K, −1.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.5 dex. To date, MUSE has been used to target 13 000 fields across the southern sky since it was first commissioned 6 yr ago and it is unique in its ability to study dense star fields such as globular clusters or the Milky Way bulge. Our method will enable the automated determination of stellar parameters for all stars in these fields. Additionally, it opens the door for applications to data collected by other spectrographs having resolution similar to LAMOST. With the upcoming BlueMUSE and MAVIS, we will gain access to a whole new range of chemical abundances with higher precision, especially critical s-process elements, such as [Y/Fe] and [Ba/Fe], that provide key age diagnostics for stellar targets.",Reliable stellar abundances of individual stars with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph  
Alina Boecker,"Thanks to Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys we now understand the past merger history of the Milky Way by examining the properties of its halo stars. For statistical samples of external galaxies however, spectroscopic observations, necessary to extract stellar population information, are mainly confined to their central regions. Using the cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 I show that even in the central 500pc the stellar mass build-up is dictated by a galaxy’s individual interaction history. The tightly bound nuclear regions of satellite galaxies survive the tidal forces during mergers and can efficiently deposit ex-situ material in the center of their host – particularly in the case of major mergers. The exact amount of accreted material in the center varies significantly at fixed galaxy type ranging from a few to nearly 50 percent for Milky Way like galaxies. TNG50 predicts that ex-situ stars are distinct from in-situ stars, as they are the oldest, most metal-poor and alpha-enhanced population. I measured similar stellar population signatures in galaxies observed with SDSS by extracting age-metallicity distributions from their integrated spectra covering the same central 500pc. By comparing the results from SDSS to realistic mock observations from TNG50 I point out current challenges faced in measuring and predicting stellar population properties on both sides. The synergy between observations and simulations is crucial and provides first evidence that galaxy centers can be used to probe past merger events. This will facilitate comparisons between the individual formation pathways of the Milky Way and its external analogues.

Ankit Kumar,"Recent studies of Milky Way kinematics in the Solar neighbourhood based on the enormous data from SEGUE, RAVE, LAMOST, and GAIA have revealed the wave-like patterns in the motion of stars. Stars coherently move away or toward the mid-plane of the Galaxy resulting in expanding or contracting breathing motion, respectively. In this meeting, we will present our recent work on the origin of this wave-like breathing motion in the Milky Way. We simulated the flyby interactions of two disk galaxies with the mass ratio of 5:1 and varied the orientation of flyby orbits. We found that the flyby interaction induces a two-armed spiral pattern in the host galaxy and the strength of this spiral pattern depends on the angle of inclination during flyby interaction. The prograde-prograde configuration of galaxy flyby induces the most strong spiral pattern. The flyby-induced spiral arms are transient density waves in nature. They form just after the pericenter passes and decay slowly after reaching maximum strength. We found that the contracting breathing motion in the disk is associated with the spiral arms, whereas the expanding breathing motion is associated with the inter-arm region. We confirmed that the breathing motion is not the direct consequence of the tidal interactions of galaxies. It is the spiral arms which originate the breathing motion in the disk of the galaxies.",Excitation of wave-like breathing motion in the Milky Way during galaxy flybys

Boquan Erwin Chen,"Other than hydrogen, helium, and a trace amount of lithium created in the Big Bang, about eighty naturally occurring elements are forged in stellar nucleosynthesis. The diverse chemical compositions of stars and interstellar gas are products of the environment and the evolutionary history of their host galaxies. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys including APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST have delivered precisely measured abundances for at least several hundred thousand stars up to 30 elements, including several elements heavier than iron. Combined with the astrometry from the \textit{Gaia} mission and asteroseismology with the \textit{Kepler} mission, we now have an unprecedented amount of data covering a wide area of our Galaxy and are able to map the chemical distribution and trace how the chemical abundances evolved over time in the solar neighbourhood and beyond. The goal of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models is to probe the mechanisms and conditions of galaxy evolution at different epochs and reproduce the chemical properties of galaxies, particularly the Milky Way. These models implement simple physical laws to generate aggregate chemical trends for a galaxy or a region within a galaxy or multiple regions simultaneously. They have far less computational demands than cosmological chemodynamical simulations and thus can cover a large area in parameter space in a short amount of time. In this talk, I will show how my GCE model reproduces the chemical distribution at different locations in the Milky Way and detailed age-abundance relationship in the solar neighbourhood.

Carme Gallart,"We are deriving unprecedentedly detailed star formation histories (SFH) for the different components of the Milky Way, from direct modelling of Gaia colour-magnitude diagrams. For this, we are using the same techniques that have been proven successful for external galaxies in the Local Group. These SFHs provide and extremely detailed view of the evolution of the stellar mass and metal content in the Milky Way, from the very first epochs of star formation, with ~10% precision in age even for the earliest epochs. From these SFHs, largely unbiased and homogeneous stellar age and metallicity distributions for the different Galactic components can be obtained. This approach provides an alternative solution to the difficult problem of deriving stellar ages, the still largely missing information necessary to interpret the wealth of information available today for Galactic Archaeology. Our first results using Gaia DR2 were extraordinarily promising and allowed us to date the first events involved in the formation of the inner Milky Way halo [1], and to determine the presence of epochs of enhanced star formation, possibly associated to the various pericentric passages of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy [2]. In this talk I will focus on two main new results: -1) the first spatially-resolved SFHs for the Milky Way disk, derived using Gaia DR3 data. They have been obtained by slicing, parallel to the plane, a cylinder spanning 1 Kpc heliocentric radius and +/-3 Kpc height from the plane. These SFHs across the Milky Way thin and thick disks show an incredibly complex evolution, with many distinct star formation episodes contributing differently at different heights above the plane. These SFHs, thus, provide unprecedentedly clear insights about the formation process of our Galactic disk. Preliminary results of this work have been presented in a seminar (http://iactalks.iac.es/talks/view/1439). -2) the first insights into the SFHs of differentiated Milky Way halo building blocks.

Chiung-Yin Chang,"To understand how the evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies affects observed dust properties, we apply a post-processing dust evolution model to galaxy merger trees from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation.   Our dust model includes stellar dust production, sputtering in hot gas, dust growth by accretion and coagulation in the dense interstellar medium (ISM), and shattering in the diffuse ISM. We decompose the grain size distribution into different dust species depending on the elemental abundances and the dense ISM fraction given by the simulation. In our previous work, we focused on Milky Way (MW) analogs and reproduced the observed MW extinction curve. In this study, we compute dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the MW analogues. Our simulated SEDs broadly reproduce the observed MW SED within their dispersion and so does the observational data of nearby galaxies, although they tend to underpredict the MW SED at short wavelengths where emission is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We find that metallicity and dense gas fraction are the most critical factors for the SED shape, through their influence on coagulation and shattering.  The overall success of our models in reproducing the MW SED further justifies the dust evolution processes included in the model and predicts the dispersion in the SEDs caused by the variety in the assembly history. We also show that the most significant increase in the dust SED occurs between redshifts z~3 and 2 in the progenitors of the simulated MW-like galaxies.",Dust SEDs in Milky Way-like galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations based on the evolution of grain size distribution
Danny Horta (1),"In the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter paradigm for the evolution of the Universe, galaxies grow in great measure by cannibalising smaller satellite systems. The intricacies of this hierarchical formation mechanism help elucidate how galaxies assemble their mass over time. For the case of the Milky Way, the era of large-scale stellar surveys has delivered an unprecedented multi-faceted view of the Galaxy. These data have enabled discoveries of stellar populations postulated to originate from disrupted satellite galaxies that have been accreted by the Milky Way over time. Albeit these exciting findings help constrain the mass assembly history of the Galaxy, the technical details of each accretion episode are not yet fully understood. In order to help tackle this problem, in this talk I will present results on the observable properties of the (massive) disrupted satellite systems in Milky Way-like galaxies from the Latte/FIRE-2 zoom-in cosmological simulations. Specifically, I will show how the stellar mass and time of accretion are fundamental parameters that work in unison and dictate how the resulting spatial distribution, orbital energy, and [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] chemical compositions of the stars belonging to the stellar debris of such mergers are manifested in observable planes. A particularly exciting result I will present is that we find that a significant fraction of the lower-mass satellites accreted at (very) early times deposit debris in the outer halo (~R$_{GC}$ > 50 kpc), that should be detectable in kinematic surveys probing deeper into the Galactic stellar halo.

Its high resolution (with a baryonic element mass of 8.5 x 10^4 Msol and average cell size of 70–140 pc in the star-forming regions of galaxies), comparable to current zoom-in simulations, allows to follow the evolution of these galaxies up to high redshift (z~6): for example, TNG50 returns more chaotic/turbulent disks at z~2-4 than today (Pillepich+2019). Also, the evolution histories are extremely diverse and z~2 progenitors of MW/M31-like galaxies extend over ~2 (~1) orders of magnitude in stellar mass (halo mass). The number and type of mergers that this galaxies undergo is very diverse, and some of them had their last major merger 10 Gyr ago but others underwent major mergers recently (in the last 5 Gyr) and are still disky today, with some of them even exhibiting a geometric thin disk of only ~200-300 kpc, like the MW (Sotillo-Ramos+2022, submitted).

Emma Dodd,"Galaxies stellar haloes are known to build up through the accretion of smaller systems, with stars from a single merger being deposited onto similar orbits. Since orbits can be characterized by their integrals of motion such as energy or angular momenta, we can thus search for the stellar debris of past accretion events by looking for over-densities in integrals of motion space (IOM). Using the Gaia DR3 data-set we identify such merger debris in the Milky Way halo near the Sun. We utilise a parameter-free clustering algorithm that allows us not only to find over-densities in IOM space but also to assess their statistical significance. We characterise the statistically significant over-densities using metallicity and chemical abundance information from Gaia DR3, LAMOST LRS DR7 and APOGEE DR17. We find that the local stellar halo contains 7 main dynamical groups, including in-situ structures, several previously known accreted substructures and one new substructure.

Emma Fernández Alvar,"The disc is the defining structural component of MW-like galaxies, and understanding its formation and evolution is crucial to verify the galaxy formation theory. The current cosmological paradigm, the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model, predicts that galaxies form by assembly of smaller substructures. However, the specific processes that lead to the current disc configuration in terms of morphological, chemical and kinematical properties are far from clear, preventing the progress of galactic formation understanding. The highly detailed results that can only be obtained from the MW are fundamental to constrain galactic formation models. Recent observational studies discovered extremely metal-poor MW stars rotating in a disc-like configuration (e.g. Fernández-Alvar et al. 2021). This puzzled the formation scenario, since such low metallicity stars are expected to form very early, when the Galaxy was still under an intense merger activity causing the heating of newborn stars and preventing a flat configuration. In this talk I will present the state-of-the art of this topic and a recent analysis confirming the existence of the metal-poor tail of the thin disc within the recent Gaia DR3 database. I will also present the implications of this discovery under the light of cosmological simulations predictions.",On the edge of the Milky Way thin disc formation
Francesca Pinna,"Stellar populations of massive galactic disks allow us to draw the mass assembly of disk-dominated galaxies. Properties of old, metal-poor thick disks trace the early stages of galaxy formation, while younger metal-rich thin disks tell us about later evolutionary phases. Both Galactic and extragalactic recent studies have revealed that thick- and thin-disk star-formation histories are regulated by the interplay of internal and external processes. However, there is still no common agreement on the balance between direct accretion of ex-situ stars and in-situ star formation, while the latter can occur both from gas enriched via internal chemical evolution and from more-pristine accreted gas. Only the comparison with state-of-the-art numerical simulations can provide the Rosetta Stone to interpret the observable properties more in depth. In this work we extract edge-on maps of stellar age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundances of 26 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the AURIGA zoom-in cosmological simulations, as well as the star-formation and chemical-evolution histories of their thin and thick disks. We compare these results to integral-field spectroscopic observations of edge-on disk galaxies and to recent findings in our Galaxy. By tracking stars across time, we unveil the relative contributions of internal evolution and external processes. Finally, mapping the evolution of stellar and gas properties, we uncover the transition from thick-disk to thin-disk formation and their evolutionary connection, allowing us to trace the full buildup of disk galaxies.  ",The interplay of internal and external processes in the buildup of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies: stellar populations of thick and thin disks in AURIGA simulations

By combining the age and metallicity information, we dissect the Galactic disc stars into four radial components, namely, the inner disc (R < 6 kpc), the local disc (6 < R < 8 kpc), the outer disc (8 < R < 10 kpc) and the most outer disc (12 > R > 10 kpc). We then examine the age-metallicity relationship across all radial regions and find our results to be consistent with a transition of the phase from the thick to thin disc starting approximately 10 Gyr ago.  We also identify, albeit tentatively, a sharp dip in metallicity happening around 12 Gyr ago, observed most clearly within the 8 < R < 10 kpc region. To understand its possible origins, we explore the AMR in two of the Auriga suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations, Au18 and Au23, where we can also observe a dip of 0.1 dex in metallicity in the outer regions, with the dip being broader in Au23. In both these simulations, this dip coincides with a gas-rich merger (Au 18) or galactic fountain event (Au 23), further supporting the scenario that the metallicity dip is likely the result of a gas dilution event. Contingent upon a proper treatment of the measurement error in the observed AMR of the Milky Way, the existence of such a dip in metallicity is a valuable diagnostic for when the last massive merger of the Milky Way took place.",The Galactic Dip: Investigating the effect of mergers on the observed age-metallicity relation in the Milky Way disc
Ivanna Escala,"The Milky Way (MW) is the cornerstone of our understanding of disk galaxy formation. However, there is growing evidence that the MW’s relatively quiescent formation history sets it apart from its sister galaxy, Andromeda (M31).  At the nexus of near- and far-field galaxy evolution, M31 provides an exquisite opportunity to expand our knowledge of hierarchical galaxy assembly and galactic chemodynamics. Outstanding questions remain concerning M31's structural assembly: has its disk survived a major merger within the last few billion years, and does this merger coincide with the formation of its Giant Stellar Stream?  In this talk, I will present novel results on the nature of M31's inner stellar halo and disk based on data from the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) and Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) surveys. With measurements for over 3500 individual red giant branch stars, this represents the first large-scale chemodynamical analysis of M31's inner disk region. I will discuss evidence in favor of (1) an inextricable connection between the formation of M31's inner stellar halo and disk, (2) distinct channels driving the formation of the stellar halo along the major versus minor axes, and (3) a uniformly thick structure for the disk.  I will conclude by placing these findings in the context of the MW and disk galaxy formation in general.",Resolved SPLASH Chemodynamics in Andromeda's PHAT Stellar Halo and Disk
Jason Hunt,"Data from ESA’s Gaia mission is already revolutionizing Galactic astronomy, providing an unprecedented view of the Solar neighborhood and beyond. However, while it provides us a great opportunity to transform our understanding of the Milky Way, it has also highlighted how far from equilibrium our Galaxy is. The spiral pattern in vertical position vs. velocity is a signature of our Galaxy’s past interaction with perturbing influences such as merging dwarf galaxies, or internal substructure. We dissect and analyze these ‘phase spirals’, showing the first discovery of two armed ‘breathing spirals’ in the inner disc, and show how we can leverage high resolution galaxy models and dynamical theory to learn about the structure and history of our Galaxy.",Vertical disequilibria in the Galactic disc
Jianhui Lian (1),"The Milky Way has a thick and a thin disk component with distinct scale height and age/abundance distributions. Deep near-IR imaging of nearby edge-on galaxies show that this dual disk structure is quite common. However, even in the MW, unanswered questions include whether the disks formed at the same time or sequentially, what caused the thick disk’s thickness, and how many phases of formation contributed to each component. Both MW and extragalactic observations are essential to disentangle thin/thick disk formation scenarios. In this talk, I will introduce work to address thin/thick disk formation by looking at the disk structure of edge-on galaxies beyond the local Universe when the present-day thick disk is expected to be already in place and the thin disk is not (fully) established yet. My analysis of JWST’s first image of Stephan's Quintet reveals 39 distant edge-on galaxy candidates, with photometric redshift out to at least 0.5. Preliminary analysis suggests diverse vertical structure of these galaxies with some even dominated by a thick disk alone, resembling the structure of the early Milky Way. I will talk about the diverse vertical structure of these galaxies and the implications for thin/thick disk formation across redshift.",Thin/thick disk structure beyond the local Universe
Jianhui Lian (2),"Our picture of how galaxies evolve and enrich the Universe relies directly on our understanding of when, where, and how our own Galaxy’s stars evolved and died. Currently, massive stellar surveys are yielding spectroscopic datasets of unprecedented size and quality for Milky Way stars well beyond the Sun. These observations reveal complex, position-dependent patterns of age and abundance that comprise the most rigorous observational constraints to date for models of Galactic star formation. In this talk, I will present our series of works in which we propose an intriguing multi-phase accretion and star formation scenario that is able to coherently explain the position-dependent complex patterns of age and chemical abundances (e.g., bimodal [α/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution and interrupted age-[Fe/H] relation) observed in the bulge, inner and outer disk of our Galaxy. This multi-phase star formation picture highlights the importance of an early quenching process in the transition from thick to thin disk formation and of a recent accretion and starburst event, possibly triggered by the pericenter passage of Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, in the thin disk formation. Taking advantage of the wide radial coverage of APOGEE data, we further quantify the radial properties of the recent gas accretion to better understand the source of this accretion event. The results of these works provide revealing insights into the thick-to-thin disk transition in the early Universe and gas accretion fueling disk formation at a large range of redshift.",A comprehensive picture of the Milky Way’s disk formation inferred from stellar age and chemical abundances
Leandro Beraldo e Silva ,"Thin disc stars are younger than thick disc stars on average, and some models predict the thin disc to start forming only after the thick disc has formed, around 10 Gyr ago. According to these sequential scenarios, no significant old thin disc population should exist. In this talk, I will show recent observational evidence for the presence, in the MW, of an old thin disc population. I will discuss how the observed trends disfavour sequential scenarios but can be nicely explained if the early MW disc had gas clumps with high star formation rate",Co-formation of the Milky Way's thin and thick discs
Martin Rey,"I present genetically-modified, cosmological simulations showing how past radial mergers imprint the stellar haloes of Milky-Way-like galaxies. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic datasets have transformed our view of the halo of the Milky Way, allowing us to identify the kinematic and chemical signatures of past merger events that happened several billion years ago. However, pinpointing the cosmological build-up of our Galaxy remains challenging – it requires models matching the extremely high level of detail available in galactic datasets, while scanning through cosmological assemblies to distinguish each formation scenario’s observables. I present a new approach to tackle this challenge, combining high-resolution (20 pc) cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies to enable detailed studies of galactic structure, with the genetic modification approach. Genetic modifications allow us to introduce a controlled change in a galaxy’s cosmological history, here growing and decreasing the significance of a radial merger at z~2 alike Gaia Enceladus, while maintaining its cosmological environment and final dynamical mass fixed. Comparing these related scenarios then enables a causal link between a galaxy’s past mergers and its observables today. Scanning from a very minor to equal-mass radial merger at z~2, I will show that all merger scenarios lead to a significant radially-biased population of halo stars as observed in the Milky Way, although with a different cosmological nature in each case and markedly distinct disc morphologies and kinematics.",The structural imprints of past radial mergers in Milky-Way-like galaxies
Mochamad Ikbal Arifyanto,"Our Galaxy consists of different stellar populations, which need to be decomposed in order to understand their formation and evolution. Decomposition methods based on kinematical and dynamical properties are more physically motivated than only from kinematical properties-based one. We use the supervised machine learning methods such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to extract stellar components from Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS) in the Gaia DR3 supplementary tables. GUMS is a synthetic catalogue of objects from the universe model for a given static time simulating the real environment where Gaia will observe. We selected GUMS data within 4 kpc from the Sun for each assigned population IDs: 1 for thin disk, 2 for thick disk and 3 for halo populations and calculated the actions JR, Jphi, Jz, zmax and eccentricity. We applied the random forest classification methods to the dynamical properties data combined with chemical properties (Fe/H and alpha/Fe).  The random forest method gave the accuracy to detect thin disk, thick disk and halo population as 81%, 77% and 93%, respectively and the precision are 71%, 68% and 93%, respectively. The actions, eccentricity, Fe/H and alpha/Fe are good in discriminating the populations. We will apply this result with Gaia DR3 data to select the thick disk component to determine its substructures.

Muhammad Ali Syaifudin,"We filtered Gaia DR3 stars in cylindrical volume with a radius of 150 pc and a height of 200 pc in the Galactic plane to determine their number density and kinematics. The main sequence of types A, F, and early G were used as tracers, which have been assumed to reach dynamical equilibrium. The completeness of Gaia DR3 was incorporated into the vertical number density calculation. The vertical kinematics of the tracers in the Galactic plane were also calculated, which results similar to Buch et al (2019). Based on the collisionless Boltzmann equation, given Galactic potential and vertical kinematics, the number density of tracers can be predicted. The Poisson equation was employed to calculate the Galactic potential from some Galactic density, from which this work will use multi-components Bahcall density model, halo dark matter, and thin dark disk. The results will be important to test the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) hypothesis, by ignoring the dark matter contribution. From the MOND framework, the critical acceleration can be calculated from the modified Poisson equation. This critical acceleration value will be compared with the literature so that it can validate whether the MOND hypothesis holds from stellar vertical dynamics.",Galactic Local Mass Density from Kinematics and MOND approach: Preliminary result
Namitha Kizhuprakkat Ramachandran,"Using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the DESI Milky Way Survey (MWS) will explore the assembly history of the Milky Way by discovering remnants of ancient dwarf galaxy accretion events and improving constraints on the Galaxy’s 3D dark matter distribution.

We report the multiple halo substructures within the solar neighbourhood traced by Red giants. Using a combining data set of recently released Gaia DR3, APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR3, we study chemodyamical properties of substructure and streams and find 2/3 fraction of halo stars having high eccentric orbits (e>0.8). Also, we study a particular substructure – Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus - halo stars and find its peak metallicity (Fe/H) is about -1.14 dex. Using the Gaussian approach we have identified the different halo substructures as well based on action angle, energy, eccentricity, and metallicity.

Rizky Maulana Nurhidayat,"Analysis of the old stellar population at different ages can represent the evolution of the Galactic warp. We want to find the possible mechanism that drives the warped disk. We analyzed the phase space of RGB stars from Gaia DR3 and crossmatched them with stars from the Kordopatis catalog to get their ages. To infer the warp parameters, we used MCMC fittingof two warped models (linear and power law) for both spatial and kinematics data. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the linear warp model gives a better approach than the power law model. The warp starts at R_w=12.37 kpc with the line of nodes ϕ_w=10.72° in spatial and shifts at 9.92 kpc and -4.08° in kinematics distribution.  The warp constant a_w remains fixed at about 0.30 in both distributions. The difference may come from the precessed rate of ϕ ̇_w=14.52 km s-1 kpc-1 and the amplitude rate of A ̇_w= 3.08 kpc Gyr-1. The eccentricity analysis of the Southern and Northern warp showed that the disk’s potential is still axisymmetric. The value of ϕ ̇_w and A ̇_w in axisymmetric potential suggests that the warp is a transient feature due to the gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxy. After the interaction, the stellar experienced a damped vertical oscillation. It is shown in the deviation in vertical position which varied in the different age ranges. The phase space analysis of RGB stars shows that the warp is a transient feature driven by the gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies.",Galactic Warp from the Phase Space of RGB Stars
Shobhit Steven Kisku,"Our understanding of the Milky Way’s formation history has seen some major advancements in recent years with the help of Gaia and other large scale surveys, in particular SDSS/APOGEE. One of the most important findings in the past several years was the discovery of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S) system, a massive dwarf galaxy that collided with the Milky Way about 10 Gyr ago. It has been proposed that the collision of GE/S caused an abrupt heating of the Galactic disk, which has been dubbed the Splash. We have identified the Splash population in the APOGEE DR17 database and ARTEMIS simulations, studying its ages, as well as chemodynamical and spatial properties.  In the simulations if we define the Splash as the retrograde in-situ population we find, when comparing the Splash fraction between simulated galaxies with and without GE/S like mergers, on average a higher Splash fraction for galaxies with GE/S like mergers.  By comparing our results to the properties of the high-alpha disk, we test this formation scenario and shed new light on the origin and evolution of the Galactic thick disk.",The chemodynamical properties of the Splash according to APOGEE and ARTEMIS
Souradeep Bhattacharya,"The nearest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way (MW) and the largest member of our local group, the Andromeda galaxy (M31) has experienced a tumultuous merger history as evidenced from the many substructures that are present in its inner halo. Through the kinematics and chemical abundance measurements of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in M31, in conjunction with the star-formation history derived from photometry of resolved stellar populations as well as the kinematics of red giant branch (RGB) stars, we have obtained stringent conditions on the recent formation history of M31. In contrast to the MW which had a quieter merger history since its last major merger ~10 Gyr ago, M31 has had its last major merger only ~2.5-4 Gyr ago. The infalling satellite fell along the giant stream (the most prominent M31 substructure seen as an extended tail of stellar debris), consistent with PN and RGB LOSVs and chemical abundance measurements, in multiple pericenter passages (inferred from the PN and RGB position-velocity phase space) that lead to the formation of other prominent M31 inner-halo substructures (again inferred from the PN and RGB position-velocity phase space). The satellite disrupted the M31 disc forming an older dynamically hotter thicker disc and younger dynamically colder thin disc. The radial chemical abundance gradient (inferred from PNe) and chemical enrichment history of the two discs, deciphered from Galactic chemical evolution models consistent with the PN [O/Ar] vs [Ar/H] (analogous to [α/Fe] vs [Fe/H] but for emission-line objects), imply that the M31 thicker disc formed in an extended star-formation episode but reached its current dynamically heated state (accompanied by a flat chemical abundance gradient) following the merger of the satellite; while the M31 thin disc formed in a burst from metal-poor gas brought in by the infalling satellite that mixed with the relatively enriched pre-merger M31 gas at certain radii. From the aforementioned results, we find that the satellite would have been gas-rich with mass about twice that of M33 and it would have fallen into M31 ~2.5-4 Gyr ago also consistent with the burst of star-formation seen throughout M31’s disc from resolved stellar populations. Our kinematic results are consistent with major merger simulations of M31 having a 1:4 merger ~2-3 Gyr ago. We thus uncover the properties of the cannibalized dwarf galaxy in M31 with great detail (amongst the if not the most stringently constrained in any galaxy) from its present day structure, dynamics and chemistry.",Constraints on the Andromeda galaxy's last major merger

Tetsuro Asano,"Astrometric observation by Gaia satellite revealed the detailed dynamical structure of the Milky Way (MW). Phase-space maps from the Gaia data show some substructures such as phase-space spirals (Antoja et al. 2018), which suggest that the satellite galaxies, especially the Sagittarius dwarf (Sgr),  are perturbing the Galactic disk. We investigated the satellites' dynamical impact on the Galactic disk using high-resolution N-body simulations. Our MW-like host model initially has a bar and spiral arms, and we take into account both external and internal perturbations. We used heavy and light Sgr-like satellite models, whose total masses are 5x10^10 M_sun and 1x10^5 M_sun, respectively. In the solar neighborhood (R ~ 8 kpc), we see phase-space spirals only for the heavy Sgr model.  However, in the inner region (R ~4 kpc), phase-space spirals are visible even for the light model.  The bar's pattern speed and strength start changing due to the external perturbation by the dwarf. Even low-mass satellites have a non-negligible impact on the dynamical evolution of the host galaxies.",Impact of the satellites on the dyncamical evolution of the Galactic disk
Valeria Grisoni,"I will discuss the chemical evolution of the thick and thin disks of the Galaxy by comparing detailed chemical evolution models with recent data from Galactic surveys. The data suggest that the stars in the thick and thin disks form two distinct sequences with the thick disk stars showing higher [α/Fe] ratios. We adopt two different approaches to model the evolution of thick and thin disks. In particular, we adopt (i) a two-infall approach where the thick disk forms fast and before the thin disk and by means of a fast gas accretion episode, whereas the thin disk forms by means of a second accretion episode on a longer time-scale; (ii) a parallel approach, where the two disks form in parallel but at different rates. By comparing our model results with the observed [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions in the two Galactic components, we conclude that the parallel approach can account for a group of α-enhanced metal-rich stars present in the data, whereas the two-infall approach cannot explain these stars unless they are the result of stellar migration. Then, we will apply the reference models to study the evolution of various chemical elements, from lithium to europium.",Chemical evolution models of the Milky Way thick and thin disks
Vasily Belokurov,"We use accurate estimates of aluminium abundance from the APOGEE Data Release 17 and Gaia Early Data Release 3 astrometry to select a highly pure sample of stars with metallicity -1.5 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ 0.5 born in-situ in the Milky Way proper. The low-metallicity ([Fe/H] ≲ -1.3) in-situ component we dub Aurora is kinematically hot with an approximately isotropic velocity ellipsoid and a modest net rotation. Aurora stars exhibit large scatter in metallicity and in many element abundance ratios. The median tangential velocity of the in-situ stars increases sharply with metallicity between [Fe/H] = -1.3 and -0.9, the transition that we call the spin-up. The observed and theoretically expected age-metallicity correlations imply that this increase reflects a rapid formation of the MW disc over ≍1-2 Gyr. The transformation of the stellar kinematics as a function of [Fe/H] is accompanied by a qualitative change in chemical abundances: the scatter drops sharply once the Galaxy builds up a disc during later epochs corresponding to [Fe/H] > -0.9. Results of galaxy formation models presented in this and other recent studies strongly indicate that the trends observed in the MW reflect generic processes during the early evolution of progenitors of MW-sized galaxies: a period of chaotic pre-disc evolution, when gas is accreted along cold narrow filaments and when stars are born in irregular configurations, and subsequent rapid disc formation. The latter signals formation of a stable hot gaseous halo around the MW progenitor, which changes the mode of gas accretion and allows development of coherently rotating disc.",Milky Way's turbulent pre-disk youth

Yanjun Sheng,"A wealth of recent studies have shown that gravitational interactions between LMC and the MW can give rise to disequilibrium phenomena in the stellar and dark matter halo of the Milky Way. Those perturbations include biased distribution of stellar density and other kinematic signatures across the sky. By matching N-body simulations of the MW-LMC interaction with observation, we can constrain multiple parameters of the two systems. In this work, we intend to build a library which consists of several high-resolution N-body models of single accretion event between LMC and the Milky Way. Each model in the library is a grid in the MW-LMC parameter space, which is mainly composed of the mass of LMC, the mass of MW, the initial kinematic state of the MW halo, the density profile of the MW and the initial distribution of the stars in stellar halo. This library can be used to analyze our current observation data of halo stars with modern machine learning methods, as well as provide guidance to future spectroscopic surveys.",MW-LMC library : explore the parameter space of the MW-LMC merger
Yoshihisa Suzuki,"Under the current standard scenario, galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW) are thought to have formed through repeated mergers and accretions of small galaxies due to gravitational interactions. Since the relaxation timescale of these traces in phase space is as long as more than 10 billion years, it has been theoretically suggested that they may still exist in the halo. Advances in large-scale observations have ushered in the era in which such traces can be investigated observationally. The MW, to which we belong, is of particular interest because it is possible to directly observe stellar streams and substructures as they are destroyed by tidal forces as small galaxies merge and accrete into it. Currently while the structure and substructures in the halo within 20-30 kpc from the center of the MW is becoming better understood from the viewpoint of chemodynamics, the structure in the outer halo is still largely unresolved. In this study we used the entire HSC-SSP data (~1400 square degrees), characterized by wide field of view (~1.8 square degrees) and deep photometry (i < 26 mag), to investigate the outer halo of the MW. In order to effectively detect the substructures in the outer halo, an isochrone-filter was created for the old, metal-poor stellar systems on the color-magnitude diagram. As a result, previously discovered substructures (e.g. the Orphan Stream) were detected, while new candidates were discovered. In this talk, we will discuss the origin of these substructures.",The Milky Way Tomography with Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam.  I. Halo Substructures
Yuan-Sen Ting,"A key yet unresolved question in modern-day astronomy is how galaxies formed and evolved under the paradigm of the ΛCDM model. The quest to understand the connection between the near-field cosmology and the high-redshift cosmic past has led to many semi-analytical models to infer the galaxy properties from their merger history. However, most of these classical approaches rely on studying the global statistical connection between dark matter haloes and galaxies, often reducing the study to focusing on the connection of individual haloes and galaxies or summarizing their formation environment with crude summary statistics based on human heuristics. The advancement in graph neural networks has opened up many new possibilities for studying the evolutionary history of galaxies. That is because a graph is a natural descriptor of the systems at hand – any progenitor system at a high redshift can be regarded as a graph, with individual progenitors as nodes on the graph. In this presentation, I will discuss the power of Equivariant Graph Normalizing Flows Model to connect high-redshift progenitor graphs with the local observables. We demonstrate that, by treating the progenitors as a graph, our model robustly recovers their distributions, including their masses, merging redshifts and pairwise distances at redshift z = 2 conditioned on their z = 0 properties. In addition, the generative nature of the model enables other downstream tasks, including inferring probabilistically the property at z=0 given the configuration at z=2, detecting anomalies and identifying subtle correlations of progenitor features.",Galaxy Merger Reconstruction with Graph Neural Networks
