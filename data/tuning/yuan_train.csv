The search for extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way is traditionally conducted using existing methods that may not provide comprehensive or accurate results.,"By mimicking a Pristine narrow-band filter in the Gaia DR3 data, we can improve the search for these rare stars, providing a more accurate all-sky distribution of the metal-poor Milky Way and enhancing our understanding of galactic assembly and star formation histories.",Observational diagnostics of the old Milky Way using the most metal-poor stars
The Galactic bulge region is typically avoided in the search for metal-poor stars due to the high density of mostly metal-rich stars and high dust extinction.,"The Galactic bulge region can be effectively studied for metal-poor stars, providing unique insights into the ancient Milky Way, by using metallicity-sensitive narrow-band CaHK photometry to identify metal-poor candidates.",Dynamical properties of ancient stars in the inner Milky Way with PIGS 
The conventional belief is that the properties of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are uniform across different Galactic environments.,"The innovative approach suggests that the properties of CEMP stars may vary between different Galactic environments, indicating differences in the early formation and chemical evolution of these environments.",On the frequency of carbon-enhanced very metal-poor stars
