"* Problem: How can we efficiently identify and study the most primitive and metal-poor stars in our Milky Way to better understand the early epoch of star formation and the hierarchical assembly of our Galaxy?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of the highly metallicity sensitive Ca H&K doublet lines around 395 nm to isolate these rare, metal-poor stars.
  * The Pristine survey, designed with a narrow-band filter around this wavelength, is used to estimate stellar metallicity for millions of FGK stars and efficiently find the lowest metallicity populations.
  * The low-resolution BP-RP spectra provided by Gaia DR3 is utilized to mimic a Pristine narrow-band filter in these data, enabling the search for these rare and old stars and providing an all-sky distribution of the metal-poor Milky Way.
  * The paper presents the first spectroscopic follow-up efforts of this new catalogue of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo.
  * The authors use a very pure sample of Gaia DR3 halo main sequence stars, selected using the reduced proper motion property, combined with metallicity from the deeper Pristine photometry to study the anomalies in the metallicity structure across different distances, contributions of the kicked-up thick disk stars and map out the metal-poor Milky Way halo across various lines of sight.
  * By expanding the number of spectroscopically studied metal-poor stars efficiently and uniformly and studying the metal-poor tail of the Galaxy, the authors aim to get a better view of some of the most intricate parts of our Galaxy and complement the analysis of galactic assembly and star formation histories in the high-redshift universe."
"* Problem: How can we gain insights into the early formation and assembly of the Milky Way through the study of the oldest, most metal-poor stars in the Galactic bulge region?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS), which employs metallicity-sensitive narrow-band CaHK photometry, to identify metal-poor star candidates in the Galactic bulge.
  * The PIGS is the largest spectroscopic survey of inner Galaxy metal-poor stars and very metal-poor stars to date, providing a substantial sample for study.
  * The paper uses the bulk PIGS radial velocities to demonstrate that the amount of inner Galaxy rotation decreases with decreasing metallicity.
  * The researchers have derived individual distances and orbits for the entire PIGS sample, which are used to study the contribution of metal-poor stars to the disky bulge and a pressure-supported component, and how this changes with metallicity.
  * The paper also examines the behaviour of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the PIGS sample.
  * The growing amount of data on metal-poor stars in the inner regions of the Milky Way, thanks to various surveys, is highlighted as a valuable resource for setting important constraints on the formation of the ancient inner Galaxy."
"* Problem: How can the frequency and properties of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars among very metal-poor stars be accurately determined and compared across different samples?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to use spectroscopic surveys to uncover large numbers of CEMP stars, which allows for the study of these stars as a population.
  * The paper suggests examining the properties of CEMP populations in different Galactic environments (inner/outer halo, bulge, dwarf galaxies) to identify potential differences in early formation and chemical evolution.
  * The author discusses the need to understand the two main classes of CEMP stars: the CEMP-no stars, which are thought to have been born carbon-rich, and the CEMP-s stars, which are enhanced in s-process elements and are usually found in binary systems.
  * The paper highlights the challenges in determining the frequency of CEMP stars among very metal-poor stars and in comparing it for different samples.
  * The author presents recent work on the comparison of various low-resolution spectroscopic samples of very metal-poor stars in the giant regime.
  * The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to pin down the properties of the populations of CEMP stars throughout the Milky Way."
"* Problem: How can the study of the most metal-poor stars (MMPs) in the Milky Way halo provide insights into the masses of the first stars, the universality of the initial mass function (IMF), and the assembly of the Galaxy in terms of chemistry and dynamics?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of Gaia's astrometric data, which is crucial for Galactic archaeology studies, in conjunction with high-resolution spectroscopic data to dissect the Galaxy in a multi-dimensional space.
  * The study focuses on a chemo-dynamical investigation of MMPs, particularly in the Galactic bulge.
  * Stars are selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy survey, which uses the Ca HK filter at CFHT/MegaCam to identify MMP candidate stars.
  * The chemistry from high-resolution Gemini/GRACE observations is used to suggest that these stars are among the oldest and were brought in during the very early Galactic assembly.
  * The paper identifies the abundances of three stars as being compatible with second generation globular clusters stars, indicating the presence of ancient and disrupted globular clusters in the inner Galaxy.
  * The study also identifies one star that points to the feasibility of forming extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-3.0) structures in the early Universe, which are now dissolved.
  * Another star with a confined disk orbit is identified as possibly being accreted very early from a fossil dwarf galaxy, which was polluted by only one low-mass supernovae."
"* Problem: How can we better understand and constrain the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms responsible for Type Ia supernovae, which are crucial for modeling galactic chemical evolution?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of theoretical nucleosynthetic yields to identify a set of elemental abundance ratios that are infrequently observed in metal-poor stars but are common across a range of Type Ia progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.
  * The authors introduce a label for stars with this abundance signature, calling them ""iron-rich metal-poor"" (IRMP) stars. These stars are formed in environments dominated by Type Ia nucleosynthesis.
  * The chemical pattern of IRMP stars is used to constrain both the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms responsible for Type Ia supernovae.
  * The authors identify three IRMP stars in the literature and homogeneously infer their elemental abundances.
  * The paper suggests that the best explanation for these stars is deflagration-to-detonation transitions in sub- or near-Chandrasekhar mass progenitors.
  * The occurrence rates of IRMP stars in our Galaxy and beyond are also analyzed to provide an additional constraint on their nature."
"* Problem: How can we better understand the early universe and the formation of the Milky Way through the study of the oldest stars in our galaxy?

* Solution:
  * Conduct new research into the chemo-dynamical properties of metal-poor inner Galaxy stars, which are predicted by cosmological simulations to have the highest density of ancient stars.
  * Analyze the information gathered from these stars to gain insights into the early Milky Way.
  * Study carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, which are suggested to be true Population II stars, enriched solely by material from the first generation of stars.
  * Examine the Galactic distribution and orbital properties of these CEMP stars.
  * Compare the findings from the study of CEMP stars with existing ideas about the early Universe and the Milky Way's formation.
  * Use the combined insights from the study of both metal-poor inner Galaxy stars and CEMP stars to refine our understanding of the early Universe and the formation of the Milky Way."
"* Problem: How can the chemo-dynamics of the metal-poor stellar populations in the Galactic Bulge be analyzed to better understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a detailed chemo-dynamical study of the metal-poor stars in the inner Galaxy, named The COMBS Survey.
  * The study uses VLT/FLAMES spectra of approximately 350 metal-poor stars to gather data for the analysis.
  * The paper discusses the results of the COMBS Survey, providing insights into the chemo-dynamics of the metal-poor stellar populations in the Galactic Bulge.
  * The implications of these results for early Milky Way formation and chemical evolution are also discussed, providing a broader context for the findings.
  * The paper also previews results from an ongoing survey of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, which are thought to be solely enriched by the first generation of stars.
  * This additional survey provides further data to support the chemo-dynamical analysis and contributes to the overall understanding of the Milky Way's formation and evolution."
"* Problem: How do the final masses of massive and very massive stars, particularly those with low metallicities, contribute to the cosmic evolution and potentially serve as progenitors for Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe)?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to study the nucleosynthesis during the advanced stages and final explosion of massive and very massive stars, which likely contribute greatly to the overall enrichment of the Universe.
  * The paper suggests examining the extreme conditions of these stars, which lead to significant radiative and mechanical feedback effects, from local to cosmic scale.
  * The paper aims to determine the final masses of these stars, particularly those with low metallicities, as they can retain huge core masses and potentially serve as progenitors for PISNe.
  * The paper proposes to investigate Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), which are very luminous explosions of massive, low-metallicity stars.
  * The paper suggests that PISNe can potentially be observed out to high redshifts due to their high explosion energies, thus providing a probe of the Universe prior to reionization."
"As the paper was withdrawn, it's impossible to conduct a structured analysis of it. Please provide a different academic paper for analysis."
"* Problem: How do galactic bars in disk galaxies influence the radial re-arrangement of stars and can this be detected through observational evidence?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes to analyze an N-body simulation to examine the changes in the radial locations of stars, termed as 'radial mixing', that occur in a disk galaxy after a bar has formed.
  * The researchers identify angle-dependent trends at all radii considered in the study, and radius-dependent trends that divide the disk into three radial 'zones'. These zones are characterized by the angle-averaged mean distance that stars have traveled to enter a given radial annulus.
  * The paper suggests that the angle- and radius-dependent trends presented should be generic results for galaxies that host evolving bars.
  * The authors discuss recent observational evidence for angle-dependent metallicity variations in the Milky Way in the context of their analysis.
  * The paper investigates the extent to which similar observations could be used to provide information about the radial re-arrangement that occurred in the disk.
  * The authors suggest avenues for future analyses that will be possible with the data from upcoming surveys performed with massively multiplexed spectrographs, such as the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph."
"* Problem: How can we accurately determine the distance visibility at different wavelengths in the presence of extinction in both Galactic and some extragalactic studies?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers conducted the ESO Public Survey ""VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV)"" and its extension ""VVV eXtended Survey (VVVX)"" to map the Milky Way bulge and the Southern mid-plane in the near-IR.
  * They monitored over 2 billion point sources within an area of about 1700 sq deg, which includes about 50 known globular clusters and over 1000 known open clusters.
  * The final products of the survey are deep JHKs-band images, and catalogues of variable point sources, and of proper motions.
  * They used different distance indicators to trace the extinction horizon along the Galactic plane, including RC giants, RR Lyrae, Cepheids, LPVs/Miras, and star clusters.
  * The researchers also used complementary information from Gaia DR3 to support their findings.
  * The results of the study were contrasted with the expected observations from major ground-based facilities like the Vera Rubin Telescope, and space missions, like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Roman Space Telescope."
"* Problem: How does the gas supply process from the several kpc scale to the central pc scale in a barred galaxy contribute to the mass growth of a supermassive black hole in a galactic center?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers performed high-resolution simulations of gas in a barred galaxy potential using the simulation code ""ASURA"". This included a wide temperature range of radiative cooling, star formation in dense and cold gas, and gas heating by supernovae.
  * They discovered that a gas ring forms within the central 1 kpc region, with a high enough gas density for the formation of gas clouds.
  * They observed that some formed clouds deviate from the ring due to cloud-cloud interactions. These clouds collide with other clouds still rotating in the ring, reducing a large part of their orbital angular momentum.
  * As a result, a few clouds eventually fall into the galactic center of 10 pc scale. This process contributes to the episodic gas supply to the galactic center.
  * They discussed the conditions of such gas supply and its possible role in the mass growth of a supermassive black hole in a galactic center."
"* Problem: How do late-type galaxies (LTGs) form and evolve, and are there distinct formation routes for classical bulges (CBs) and pseudo-bulges (PBs)?

* Solution:
  * The paper analyzes the star formation histories (SFHs) of bulges and disks for 135 LTGs from the CALIFA survey, covering a relevant range in LTG mass.
  * The physical properties of these galaxies are contrasted with predictions from evolutionary synthesis models, which adopt exponentially declining SFHs with an e-folding time between 0.1 and 20 Gyr.
  * The analysis reveals that the main properties of bulges and disks show a continuous distribution across total stellar mass, suggesting a unified formation process rather than distinct routes for CBs and PBs.
  * The paper finds that the e-folding time in high-mass LTGs radially increases, suggesting these galaxies grow in an inside-out fashion, while lower-mass LTGs display roughly the same e-folding time throughout their entire radial extent.
  * The evolutionary synthesis predictions are found to be consistent with the observations, supporting the proposed unified formation process.
  * The paper concludes that bulges and disks of higher mass LTGs exhibit shorter formation timescales compared to their lower mass counterparts, and that bulges are assembled with their parent disks by gradual inside-out growth, regulated by the depth of the galactic potential."
"* Problem: How can the orbital composition of stars in the bar and associated features, particularly the X feature, in disk galaxies be better understood?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a novel approach to understanding the origins of the transient and persistent resonant families that populate the X feature in disk galaxies.
  * The authors use high resolution N-body simulations of barred galaxies to track individual stellar orbits. This method allows for a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms populating the X feature.
  * The paper builds on existing literature investigations to provide a comprehensive understanding of the X feature and its role in barred galaxies.
  * The authors identify the mechanisms populating the X feature, providing new insights into the structure and composition of barred galaxies.

"* Problem: How do the X structures, associated with bars in disk galaxies, form and evolve over cosmological time?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of high-resolution N-body simulations of barred galaxies to study the formation and evolution of X structures.
  * The simulations allow for the tracing of the origin of stars that populate the X or boxy/peanut structure associated with the bar.
  * The authors separate and track individual stellar orbits that form the X feature, providing a detailed understanding of its formation process.
  * Through resonance passage and dynamical bar evolution, the study identifies the formation and evolution of the X feature.
  * The study also provides insights into the transportation of gas and angular momentum in disk galaxies, contributing to the understanding of the role of bars in these galaxies.
  * The results of this study help to better understand the orbital composition and origin of the stars of the bar and associated features in disk galaxies."
"* Problem: How does the presence of bars in galaxies influence the growth of black hole masses?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers conducted a statistical study of black hole masses in barred and unbarred galaxies using the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological simulation suites.
  * They examined 1191 barred galaxies and 2738 unbarred galaxies, using an equal number of each for an unbiased study, ensuring a similar distribution of controlling parameters like total galaxy mass, halo mass, and gas mass.
  * They found that the median peak value of black hole masses distribution for barred galaxies is higher than that of the unbarred ones.
  * They discovered that the higher mean accretion rate on the black hole averaged over large redshifts supports the higher mean black hole masses in barred galaxies.
  * They tested and confirmed that these results are not affected by other surrounding environmental processes like the neighboring gas density of hosts and merger histories, which includes both minor and major mergers.
  * They provided constraints on black hole statistics to be observed for 3 sigma detection of their results, which could have implications for triggering AGN activities, a topic that has been highly debated but not yet clear in previous numerical and observational studies."
"* Problem: How can the halo spin and halo concentration of a low surface brightness, gas rich dwarf barred galaxy be accurately estimated?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a method for estimating the halo spin and halo concentration of a low surface brightness (LSB), gas rich dwarf barred galaxy UGC 5288 by forward modelling disk properties.
  * The disk properties used for the modelling include stellar and gas surface densities, disk scale length, HI rotation curve, bar length and bar ellipticity derived from observations.
  * The paper combines semi analytical techniques, N-body/SPH and cosmological simulations to model the dark matter halo of UGC 5288 with both a cuspy Hernquist profile and a flat-core pseudo-isothermal profile.
  * The best match with observations is found to be a pseudo-isothermal halo model with core radius rc = 0.23 kpc, a high halo spin λ= 0.08 at the virial radius.
  * The paper shows that the model of halo spin distribution matches with that of similar mass analogues of UGC 5288 galaxies in the high resolution cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG-50.
  * The paper also finds that the inner halo spin in barred galaxies is different from the unbarred ones, and the halo spin shows weak correlations with bar properties."
"* Problem: How do galactic bars form and evolve in complex environments, and why does bar formation sometimes fail?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers use high-resolution simulations of 13 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) project to investigate bar formation.
  * They examine whether the simulated galaxies have bars, how these bars form, and under what circumstances bar formation fails.
  * They compare the morphological differences between the bars in the FIRE2 simulations and those in the TNG50 simulations, linking these differences to variations in the physics implementations of the two codes.
  * They find that the stellar feedback prescription in FIRE2, which impacts starburst and gas dynamics, and the absence of blackhole feedback to mitigate the gas in the galaxy center, together make the disk kinematically hot, resulting in shorter, faster-rotating, and mostly short-lived bars.
  * They hypothesize that the upcoming FIRE3 simulations, with improved stellar feedback and AGN, will produce bars that more closely resemble those observed in reality."
"* Problem: How can the formation of boxy/peanut (B/P) bulges in galaxies, particularly through strong buckling events, be accurately identified and quantified?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of simulations to demonstrate that a residual mid-plane asymmetry persists when the buckling instability is strong, breaking the symmetry in the density distribution with respect to the mid-plane.
  * The researchers develop a diagnostic test to quantify this mid-plane asymmetry in nearly edge-on galaxies, which can indicate the occurrence of a buckling event.
  * The diagnostic test is applied to a small sample of galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
  * The results of the application of the diagnostic test show no clear evidence of mid-plane asymmetry associated with past buckling events, suggesting that the formation of B/P bulges through strong buckling may be a rare event.
  * The paper suggests that the developed diagnostic test can be applied to the Milky Way to explore the formation scenario of the B/P bulge in our own galaxy."
"* Problem: How can the bar pattern speed of stellar bars be accurately measured to understand their role in the secular evolution of their host galaxies and to confirm if the dark matter is able to exert an efficient friction?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of the Tremaine-Weinberg method, which is the only direct method to derive the bar pattern speed of stellar bars.
  * The authors suggest applying the Tremaine-Weinberg method to bars up to z~1-2 to reveal if the expected bar evolutionary path is taking place.
  * The paper recommends using high resolution N-body simulations to test and confirm the applicability of the Tremaine-Weinberg method to deep spectroscopy.
  * The authors propose using the NIRSpec IFU mounted to the JWST for deep spectroscopy of a sample of bars at z~1-2 that were recently revealed with the CEERS NIRCam.
  * The paper presents the result of a preliminary analysis, which will be used to prepare an observational proposal to get dedicated NIRSpec@JWST in the next call.
  * The authors aim to resolve the tension between the observations conducted to date in the local universe and the LCDM model by confirming if the dark matter is able to exert an efficient friction."
"* Problem: How does the environment affect the structure, morphology, and physical properties of galaxies in the early stages of their evolution?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers compiled catalogs of four protoclusters at z ∼ 2, consisting of 331 Hα-emitting star-forming galaxies (HAEs) to investigate their environmental dependence.
  * They characterized the size and apparent morphologies of these galaxies using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera Surveys (HST/ACS) in the F814W filter.
  * The structures of 138 HAEs in protoclusters detected by HST/ACS were compared to a coeval comparison field sample of 462 HAEs.
  * The size of the galaxies was measured by Sérsic profile fitting and the morphologies were determined by non-parametric methods.
  * The researchers found that the size distributions of protocluster and field HAEs were similar, suggesting that the environment does not significantly affect the size of galaxies during the star-forming phase.
  * Based on Sérsic index and non-parametric morphologies, they found that HAE morphologies at z~2 in rest-frame UV are consistent with disk-like star-forming galaxies, although about 20% of HAEs have peculiar morphologies.
  * They also found that protocluster HAEs are slightly more concentrated than field HAEs, especially in the highly star-forming subsamples.
  * The researchers estimated the merger fraction in protoclusters to be 38 ± 7% and 26 ± 3% in the field, suggesting a correlation between starbursts and peculiar morphologies, which may be caused by the presence of giant star-forming clumps or merger signatures."
"* Problem: How can we identify potential host galaxies for long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) in the universe, particularly those with high star formation rates and low metallicity?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used the IllustrisTNG suite, a large volume, cosmological, gravo-magneto-hydrodynamical simulation that includes a comprehensive model for galaxy formation, to simulate the evolution of dark matter, cosmic gas, luminous stars, and supermassive black holes from redshift z=127 to 0.
  * They specifically used the TNG100 run for analysis, which has a size of 110.7^3 Mpc^3 and contains more than 10 billion resolution elements.
  * They aimed to create a sample of galaxies in TNG that could potentially host LGRBs, which are violent core-collapse events of massive stars that indicate intense star formation and can be detected at cosmic distances.
  * They sought to find mergers where one progenitor has low metallicity and the descendant galaxy has a large star formation rate (SFR), analyzing this sample statistically for every snapshot to compare with observational LGRB host samples and refine their model.
  * They processed the catalogue data and merger trees for all snapshots of the TNG100 run and gathered all the subhalo properties found by the subfind algorithm with non-zero metallicity that took part in a merger event.
  * They filtered the events so that one of the progenitors has low metallicity, lower than the mass-weighted average metallicity at z=2, and the descendant galaxy has a higher SFR than the average at the given redshift. They then gathered all properties of the filtered progenitor galaxies and the descendant galaxies of the mergers."
"Without the full text of the academic paper, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis. However, based on the brief description provided, here's a potential analysis:

* Problem: How do disk formation, ring formation, and the formation and survival of giant clumps occur in high-z disks at high redshift above a threshold mass?

* Solution: 
  - The paper first proposes a theoretical framework for understanding disk formation at high redshift above a threshold mass.
  - It then discusses the conditions necessary for the survival of these disks once formed.
  - The paper further explores the process of ring formation within these high-z disks.
  - It also delves into the formation of giant clumps within these disks.
  - Finally, the paper discusses the survival mechanisms of these giant clumps in the high-z disks. 

Please note that this is a hypothetical analysis and the actual content of the paper may propose different solutions or methods."
"* Problem: What physical processes regulate star formation and the morphology of galaxies in dense environments, and why does galaxy evolution depend on the environment?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to use the deep observations taken in the context of the GLASS-JWST-ERS program that targeted the massive cluster A2744 at z=0.3, a key epoch as clusters are in a fast mass-growing phase.
  * The study will utilize NIRCAM data that observed galaxies at different clustercentric distances to understand how their morphology and star forming properties depend on their position within the cluster and their local environment.

"* Problem: How can we improve our understanding of the chemical substructures of galaxies at both low- and high-redshift, given that the linear gradient models that describe the local universe cannot be applied to distant galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of geostatistical modelling as a potential solution to understand the chemical substructures of galaxies at both low- and high-redshift.
  * The author suggests fitting a hierarchical model to data from the James Webb Space Telescope Grism Lens-Amplified Survey (JWST-GLASS) to investigate the spatial extent of metal-rich clumps.
  * The paper explores how the spatial extent of these metal-rich clumps evolves throughout cosmic time.
  * This approach allows for an understanding of the spread of metals throughout galaxies on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales.
  * The author tests subgrid models of metal mixing using this approach.
  * Ultimately, the paper aims to improve our understanding of galaxy evolution by studying the distribution and evolution of metals in galaxies."

  * The author suggests replacing the traditional color cuts method for massive galaxy selection with a machine learning algorithm, which can potentially improve the accuracy of the selection process.
  * The paper demonstrates how to search for massive potential deflectors, which is the first step in getting pure lens candidates.
  * The author emphasizes the need to minimize false positives in the sample to ensure the accuracy of the lens candidates.
  * The paper also highlights the potential applications of this method in studying the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters, and in searching high redshift objects using their magnification.
  * The author concludes by suggesting that this method could lead to the discovery of more gravitational lenses, which have so far been found in very few numbers."
"* Problem: How can we fully characterize the chemical enrichment, assembly, and star formation histories of disc galaxies by examining the fossil records encoded in their descendants across cosmic time?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to measure integrated chemical abundance patterns in a large sample of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) at high redshifts (0.6 ≤ z ≤ 0.75) from the LEGA-C survey.
  * The authors aim to reveal insights about chemical enrichment regulation, star formation timescales, and galaxy quenching through these measurements.
  * The paper suggests measuring spatially-resolved stellar population parameters in the LEGA-C ETGs using full-spectrum stellar population synthesis models over different apertures.
  * These models are designed to simultaneously fit for ages, metallicities, and detailed chemical abundances.
  * The authors discuss their findings concerning stellar population gradients and their implications for galaxy evolution.
  * In the future, these methods will be applied to the approved Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program, extending this analysis to higher redshifts (1.0 < z < 2.5) and including star-forming and quiescent galaxies. This will provide a deeper understanding of the formation histories of early-type galaxies and their late-type progenitors over approximately 5 billion years of cosmic time."
"* Problem: How do stellar feedback-driven outflows, a critical process in galaxy formation, depend on galaxy properties and redshift?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to use simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to predict how outflows depend on galaxy properties and redshift.
  * The author plans to interpret the results from the FIRE simulations using analytic toy models to better understand the underlying processes.
  * The implications of these results for the emergence of disk galaxies will be discussed, providing a broader context for the findings.
  * The author suggests that the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can provide further insight into this key component of galaxy formation models, indicating potential future research directions."
"* Problem: How does the large-scale environment around a star-forming galaxy influence the process of star formation and the behavior of circumgalactic gas?

* Solution: 
  * The paper uses the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation to study the impact of the large-scale environment on star-forming galaxies.
  * It proposes that the large-scale environment triggers new episodes of star formation in a galaxy, suggesting a direct link between the environment and star formation.
  * The paper identifies a pattern of episodic star formation that is synchronized with the pulsating motion of the circumgalactic gas.
  * The circumgalactic gas receives angular momentum modulations from the large-scale environment, which results in in-spiralling gas that fuels the star-forming reservoir.
  * The circumgalactic gas is also affected by feedback activities from the galaxy centre, which further influences the star formation process.
  * The paper concludes that a present-day star-forming galaxy may have gone through several cycles of star-forming and quiescent phases during its evolutionary history, with the circumgalactic gas carrying out a synchronized cadence of ""breathing in and out"" motions out to ∼100 kpc."
"* Problem: How can we directly observe and understand the impact of galaxy scale winds on the early growth of disk galaxies, particularly at high redshifts?

* Solution:
  * Utilize detailed imaging with Keck/KCWI of outflows in local star bursting, high [OIII] EW, low metallicity disk galaxies, which can serve as analogues of the early universe.
  * Create sub-kiloparsec resolved maps of the outflows reaching approximately 10 kpc from the disk, and directly measure parameters such as opening angle, covering fraction and mass loading factors.
  * Develop a new method for characterising star-formation driven outflows in edge-on galaxies, which can be applied to larger surveys with JWST or in the future ELT.
  * Make direct estimates of the metallicity of the outflow using the auroral emission lines, providing a new perspective on the baryon cycle.
  * Use these observations to inform models of how the Milky Way may have grown early on, and to help interpretation of results from JWST.
  * Present the first ever full image of the baryon cycle, as viewed through metallicity, on a starbursting disk galaxy."
"* Problem: How can the formation of exponential star-forming disks and the corresponding metal enrichment be explained within the modified accretion disk (MAD) framework?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes treating the galactic gas disk as a simple gas-regulator system, where the star formation rate (SFR) is instantaneously determined by the gas content.
  * The gas content is regulated by the interplay between inflow, outflow, and star formation, according to the MAD framework.
  * Using this model, the paper derives an analytic solution for the radial profile of the gas-phase metallicity, which aligns well with observed features.
  * The negative gradient of gas-phase metallicity is explained as a natural outcome of the radial inflow of cold gas, which is continuously enriched by in-situ star formation.
  * The paper suggests that magnetic stresses from magneto-rotational instability are the most plausible source of the viscosity required to sustain the exponential star-forming disk."
"* Problem: How does the feedback process of massive stars impact star formation in local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPG)?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations to study the impacts of feedback processes of massive stars on star formation in EMPGs.
  * The simulations include both radiation and supernova (SN) feedback to provide a comprehensive understanding of the feedback processes.
  * The study finds that photoionized gas is rapidly evaporated from the galaxies because the thermal pressure is stronger than the gravitational force, which effectively suppresses star formation before the SN feedback turns on.
  * The paper also explores the impact of low metallicity on star formation, finding that in cases with < 0.1Zsun, star formation is more suppressed due to smaller dust attenuation.
  * The simulation results are compared with recent observations of local EMPGs with H-alpha emission to validate the findings.
  * The results of the study align well with the observed surface brightness distribution of the H-alpha line, indicating that the simulations accurately represent the feedback processes in EMPGs."
"* Problem: How can we effectively measure and model the kinematics of early galaxies to better understand galaxy formation and its connection to later phases in cosmic history?

* Solution:
  * Utilize the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe rest-frame optical emission lines such as Halpha or [OIII] in star-forming galaxies at 3<z<9, which have been well studied at lower redshifts.
  * Employ JWST’s NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) to study spatially resolved emission lines, enabling the measurement and modeling of the kinematics of early galaxies.
  * Present the first results from the Galaxy Assembly IFS program of 42 3<z<9 galaxies of the NIRSpec GTO team, with a particular focus on disk galaxy kinematics and outflows.

"* Problem: How can we understand the formation of galaxies in the early Universe and develop theoretical models that align with data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers conducted cosmological radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of the first massive galaxy formation using a new simulation project called FOREVER22.
  * They studied galaxies in overdense regions and found that these galaxies have high star formation rates larger than ten solar masses per year at a redshift of 10.
  * They discovered that the stellar masses of these galaxies can reach up to 10^9 solar masses.
  * They observed that the morphology of galaxies drastically changes over time due to major mergers and stellar feedback, which aligns with recent observations by JWST.
  * The researchers also presented multi-wavelength radiative properties of galaxies using radiative transfer simulations."
"* Problem: How do environmental factors and interactions within high-density regions influence the star-forming activities and evolution of low-mass galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers conducted deep narrow-band observations for two proto-clusters and the general field in COSMOS at z~2 to study the star-forming activities of low-mass galaxies.
  * They identified a clumpy young proto-cluster, USS1558, at z=2.53, where they found many star-forming galaxies well above the star-forming main sequence at the low-mass end for the field galaxies, suggesting environmental effects.
  * They compared the massive side of USS1558 and a more evolved proto-cluster, PKS1138 at z=2.16, with the field galaxies and found no significant differences in the distribution on the main sequence diagram.
  * They observed that the star-forming activity within individual galaxies in the proto-clusters is more centrally concentrated than those in the field, possibly due to enhanced interactions between galaxies in the proto-cluster.
  * They proposed that these interactions can cause the gas to lose its angular momentum, drive it towards the galaxy center, and lead to a central starburst.
  * They discovered unique objects that are detected only in the narrow-band and not in the broad-bands, which are expected to be very young galaxies in formation with intense star formation but with extremely low stellar mass yet."
"* Problem: How can the formation of dark-matter-deficient galaxies, which contradict the standard galaxy formation model, be explained?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes that the formation of dark-matter-deficient galaxies can be explained by collisions between gas-rich dark matter subhalos (DMSHs) within the context of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm.
  * The authors analyze a bifurcation between the formation of dark-matter-dominated galaxies and dark-matter-deficient galaxies, which corresponds to the collision velocity of DMSHs moving in a host halo.
  * In low-speed collisions, a dark-matter-dominated galaxy is formed by merging two DMSHs. In middle-speed encounters, the two DMSHs penetrate each other, but the gaseous mediums collide, forming a dwarf galaxy without dark matter.
  * In high-speed collisions, shock-breakout occurs due to the shock waves generated at the collision surface reaching the gas surface, and no galaxy formation occurs.
  * The authors then simulate head-on collisions between DMSHs with the same mass range from 10^7 Msun to 10^10 Msun.
  * The results of the simulation show that dark-matter-deficient galaxies with total masses ranging from 10^7 Msun to 10^9 Msun are formed from the colliding gas with 0.1 solar metallicity, depending on the mass of DMSHs and the collision velocities."
"* Problem: How can the accuracy of star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (Mstar) estimations in galaxies be improved, given the limitations of current infrared (IR) luminosity-based calibrations?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE to build a comprehensive library of galaxy models, covering a wide range of star-forming conditions and interstellar medium (ISM) properties.
  * A new SFR calibration is introduced, which combines the WISE Band-1 (3 um) and Band-3 (12 um), as well as the JWST NIR-200W (2 um) and MIRI-2100W (21 um).
  * The inclusion of a stellar mass tracer in the SFR calibrations is suggested to account for the contribution of old stellar populations in the heating of the dust, leading to more reliable SFR estimations across the SFR range, particularly for low-SFR galaxies.
  * The paper recommends including the extinction as a parameter (when available) to obtain more reliable IR-based SFR, even for low dust-content galaxies, eliminating the need for hybrid (e.g. IR+ultraviolet) SFR indicators.
  * Updated calibrations for the mass-to-light ratio for the WISE band-1, and JWST NIR-200W bands are provided, which account for the effect of extinction on the optical colours of the stellar populations.
  * By understanding the galaxies’ star-formation histories and ISM condition, the role of these factors in the bias and scatter of the estimated SFRs for galaxies with different specific SFR and dust content can be quantified.
  * The calibrations are provided separately through Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC), and machine learning fitting techniques that yield similar results, demonstrating method independence."
"* Problem: How do radial color gradients within galaxies, which arise from stellar population gradients, provide statistical constraints on galaxy evolution models?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers measure color gradients for low-redshift galaxies using photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, with a sample comprising ~63,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and ~480,000 galaxies with photometric redshifts.
  * They find that the color gradients of most galaxies in this sample are negative (redder in the center), which is consistent with existing literature.
  * The team investigates the relationship between color gradient, overall g-r and r-z color, Mr, M*, and sSFR, finding that redder galaxies tend to have steeper color gradients.
  * They observe trends of gradients with Mr (M*) showing an inflection around Mr~ -21 (log 10 M*/Msun ~10.5). For less massive galaxies, color gradients become steeper with increasing M*, whereas color gradients in more massive galaxies become shallower.
  * The researchers also compute color gradients for Illustris-TNG galaxies using mock SDSS images. The trends with Mr and M* in the simulation are consistent with their observational results, but the trends of g-r and sSFR behave differently.
  * They attribute the difference in trends to an excess of low-redshift star formation in massive TNG galaxies, supporting the concordance CDM galaxy formation theory, in which galaxies assemble inside-out through dissipative collapse and star formation is strongly suppressed by AGN feedback above a critical mass."
"* Problem: How can the intrinsic properties generated by cosmological hydrodynamics simulations be made directly comparable to the measured properties of observed galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers developed a forward modelling tool called SKIRT to generate realistic synthetic images, SEDs, and spectra for galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamics simulations.
  * The tool accounts for different stellar populations, the disturbing effects of the dusty ISM, and the 3D geometry of galaxies, making the synthetic data immediately comparable to observational data.
  * The researchers compared synthetic data from different cosmological simulations (EAGLE, TNG, Auriga, ARTEMIS…) to observational data from UV to mm wavelengths.
  * They derived the cosmic spectral energy distribution, multi-band luminosity functions, and scaling relations for different cosmological simulations, and compared these to recent observations.
  * The researchers presented high-resolution multi-wavelength imaging data for a large suite of Milky Way-type galaxies, and made a morphological comparison with well-resolved spiral galaxies in the Local Universe.
  * They found that simulated galaxies largely reproduce the observed morphological trends as a function of wavelength, although they appear to be more clumpy and less symmetrical than observed."
"* Problem: How can we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, particularly those at a redshift greater than 6 during the epoch of reionization?

* Solution:
  * Utilize the JWST COSMOS-Web survey, which is set to map a contiguous 0.6 deg^2 area using NIRCam and a 0.2 deg^2 area using MIRI, to gather data.
  * Leverage the most ambitious Cycle 1 JWST program, which covers the largest area at this depth and has the most time allocated, to maximize data collection.

  * Use the collected data to gain an unprecedented view of the formation and evolution of galaxies.
  * Characterize the first galaxies using the data collected from the survey.
  * Map the spatial distribution of these early galaxies in the Universe using the data from the survey."
"* Problem: How do relic galaxies and compact massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) have distinct evolutionary pathways, despite having similar formation conditions?

* Solution: 
  * The paper uses the high-resolution cosmological simulation Illustris TNG-50 to investigate the assembly history of a sample of massive and compact early-type galaxies (ETGs) at z=0.
  * The study compares these ETGs with relic galaxies that had similar formation conditions, focusing on the mechanisms that led to their distinct evolutionary pathways.
  * Two numerical approaches are used to investigate the different pathways: kinematic effects on subhalos based on separation of stellar constituents into different morphological components, and the global environmental framework.
  * The paper presents results based on the kinematic dynamical decomposition of the simulated galaxies.
  * Preliminary results indicate a trend of some galaxies to preserve the disk component until z = 0, showing dynamical signatures in the orbital angular momentum of stellar particles.
  * These dynamical signatures can be used as an orbital parameter to look for similar structures in observations, providing clues about the intrinsic processes related to the formation and evolution of massive ETGs."
"* Problem: How can the impact of contamination from low/intermediate redshift galaxies on the photometric selections of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies be accurately assessed?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes studying the spatial correlation between intermediate and high redshift galaxies in large-area surveys conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope.
  * The authors suggest linking this spatial correlation to the leakage fraction, which represents the degree of contamination.
  * The paper recommends comparing the observed correlations from various Hubble Space Telescope surveys to outcomes from Monte Carlo simulations of leakage.
  * The authors find that ultradeep observations in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field appear to have negligible contamination.
  * The paper concludes that larger area surveys such as the CANDELS GOODS-S and BoRG might have underestimated the purity of photometric samples, indicating a need for more accurate contamination assessment methods."
"* Problem: How can the kinematic properties of cluster galaxies and the diffuse intracluster light be accurately explored and predicted?

* Solution:

  * The model is calibrated through comparisons to the observed Fundamental Plane of surviving cluster satellites. This step ensures that the model's predictions align with real-world observations.
  * The research is currently working on predicting the projected velocity dispersion profiles of massive clusters. This prediction would provide valuable insights into the behavior and properties of these clusters.
  * The paper also explores correlations between the origin of intracluster light (ICL), stellar populations, and kinematics. Understanding these correlations could shed light on the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters.
  * The researchers are developing methods to detect and characterize ICL substructure using kinematic tracers, such as planetary nebulae and globular clusters. These methods could provide a new way to study the structure and composition of galaxy clusters."
"* Problem: How do massive disk-like galaxies at redshifts z>3 build up their mass within the early years of the universe, and what implications does this have for our understanding of galaxy formation and hierarchical simulations?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers observed a sample of 17 massive galaxies at 3<z<4 using deep H and K−band spectra from the Keck/MOSFIRE and VLT/KMOS near-infrared spectrographs.
  * They determined a high-velocity dispersion of order 255 km/s based on [OIII] and Hbeta emission lines.
  * They combined these velocity measurements with size measurements based on HST/WFC3 F160W imaging to infer the dynamical masses of the galaxies.
  * The researchers found that the small effective radius of 2.9 +- 0.15 is broadly consistent with the high stellar masses, indicating that these galaxies are indeed massive.
  * The UVJ rest frame colors showed that the sample is composed of star-forming galaxies, and the [OIII]/Hbeta ratios indicated the presence of AGNs, which can influence the rapid quenching experienced by massive galaxies in the early universe.
  * The researchers concluded that the dynamical masses are consistent with the stellar masses for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), suggesting that these galaxies formed through standard processes.
  * The paper suggests that future imaging and spectroscopic observations with resolved kinematics using the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope could further constrain the formation mechanisms of these massive galaxies."
"* Problem: How can the properties of galaxies within the 7<z<9 range be determined based on broadband imaging, and how do these properties align with predictions from cosmological simulations?

* Solution:
  * The paper uses the James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam-led determination of galaxy properties based on broadband imaging as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science program.
  * The researchers identify 13 galaxies with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 8 in F444W from 8 arcmin2 of data at m< 28, using a combination of dropout and photometric redshift selection.
  * The paper presents the star formation main sequence of these galaxies and compares it with predictions from simulations, finding a consistent match.
  * The researchers introduce an analytical framework to constrain the main-sequence evolution at z<7 based on galaxy ages and basic assumptions.
  * Through this framework, they find results that are consistent with expectations from cosmological simulations.
  * If time allows, the paper also discusses the number density of these sources and whether their UV luminosity function is consistent with those previously determined from Hubble Space Telescope data."
"* Problem: How can the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of disc galaxies at higher redshifts be accurately determined, given the challenges in obtaining reliable rotation curves?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of rotation curve decomposition as a method to constrain the SHMR of disc galaxies in the local Universe.
  * The authors present new results on the SHMR of disc galaxies at z=1, a period when the Universe was roughly its current age.
  * These results are based on a set of robust rotation curves derived from non-parametric state-of-the-art kinematic modelling of resolved IFU observations.
  * The authors also employ robust mass modelling within a Bayesian framework to further support their findings.
  * The paper presents a comparison between the observed SHMR and its theoretical counterpart from abundance-matching, highlighting their similarities and discrepancies.
  * The authors discuss the physical processes behind these similarities and discrepancies, emphasizing the importance of understanding these results to benchmark the SHMR and other scaling relations in the era of JWST."
"* Problem: How does the baryonic specific angular momentum relate to the mass of disc galaxies, and what is the nature of the scaling law between the gas content, mass, and angular momentum of these galaxies?

* Solution:
  * The researchers used a large sample of nearby disc galaxies with high-quality stellar surface brightness profiles and gas kinematics to study the baryonic specific angular momentum.
  * They discovered a well-defined, unbroken power law relationship between the baryonic mass and the baryonic specific angular momentum of disc galaxies, contradicting previous claims.
  * The researchers found that disc galaxies retain about 70% of the specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes on average.
  * They identified a new scaling relation between the gas content of galaxies and their mass and angular momentum, which has a very low intrinsic scatter, making it one of the tightest empirical scaling relations of galaxies.
  * The researchers observed that even extreme galaxies like ""super-spiral"", ""super-thin"", or ""ultra-diffuse"" galaxies closely follow this new scaling relation, indicating its fundamental nature.
  * The new scaling law can be used to test the outcomes of models and simulations, and will provide a crucial comparison benchmark for upcoming high-z observations.
  * The researchers briefly discussed the possible physical mechanisms that could give rise to such a relation, particularly those related to gas disc instabilities."
"* Problem: How does the relationship between the sizes of galaxies and their dark matter haloes vary based on the stellar mass of the galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers re-examine the relationship between galaxy sizes and dark matter haloes using weak gravitational lensing, a method that directly probes dark matter distribution around luminous galaxies.
  * They use a sample of approximately 270,000 galaxies, each more massive than logM*=9 and within z<0.3, drawn from the Subaru-HSC survey PDR2.
  * The galaxy half-light radius is measured by fitting a single Sersic light profile to galaxy images, which helps establish a galaxy size-stellar mass relation.
  * The sample galaxies are divided into bins of stellar mass, and corresponding stacked weak lensing signals are obtained. These signals are modeled to infer a stellar mass-halo mass relation.
  * The researchers then combine the galaxy size - stellar mass relation and the stellar mass - halo mass relation to map galaxy sizes onto dark matter haloes.
  * The findings reveal that the galaxy size - halo radius relation is not linear and depends on the stellar mass of galaxies. The ratio of galaxy size/halo radius decreases by a factor of two as one moves from low mass dwarf/disk galaxies to high mass early-type galaxies. This trend remains consistent even when using different stellar mass - halo mass relations from previous works."
"* Problem: How can galaxy formation simulations be used to guide and interpret observations of massive high-redshift galaxies?

* Solution:

  * The authors use sophisticated radiative transfer techniques to derive predictions for the full rest-frame far-ultraviolet-to-far-infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of these simulated galaxies.
  * They also generate extremely well-resolved maps of the multi-wavelength emission of these galaxies, creating a suite of synthetic observations.
  * These synthetic observations are then used for more robust comparison with actual observations of galaxies.
  * The paper illustrates the range of projects ongoing with the dataset using several examples, including a study of the relation between physical galaxy size and the extent of the emission at multiple wavelengths and a study of the robustness of inferring dust mass from dust continuum emission.
  * Finally, the paper discusses progress in improving the efficiency of mapping simulations to 'observer space' using a new emulator technique."
"* Problem: How can we better understand the early phases of galaxy formation, particularly the physical properties of early disc systems or disc progenitors, and their co-evolution with AGNs?

"* Problem: How can deep learning techniques be utilized to analyze galaxy parameters and estimate redshifts using the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) Public Data Release 2 (PDR2) data?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used the Keras sequential model from the Python package to predict y-band data from g-, r-, i-, and z- band photometry, and to estimate the redshifts of galaxies from g-, r-, i-, z-, and y- band photometry.
  * They optimized their inputs by normalizing fluxes, magnitudes, and colors. This step was crucial in improving the accuracy of their predictions.
  * The researchers found that flux with individual galaxy normalization could obtain the best performance of r2 values (>0.95 for photometry estimation and >0.70 for redshift estimation).
  * They attempted to separate the sample into different redshift bins as various classifications, but did not find better results than their regression models.

  * The MOS mode uses an array of individually-addressable micro shutters, which allows for the observation of multiple targets at once.
  * The paper suggests using the diffraction-limited PSF long-wards of 2.4μm to yield resolved information along-the-slit within each single 460mas shutter.
  * The authors plan to present a compendium of spatially-resolved galaxy properties from the first MOS pointings of the NIRSpec GTO program, which is expected to execute in the autumn in GOODS-S.
  * The preliminary analysis will focus on quantifying the radial extent, clumpiness, and internal gradients of emission-line disks for all spatially-resolved galaxies in the dataset, from z~2 up to and beyond z~6.
  * These data will provide an initial assessment of the expected quality for the bulk of the GTO MOS program to come in 2023, and will aid in appropriate corrections to global galaxy parameters."
"* Problem: How does energetic feedback from star formation influence the formation and evolution of disk galaxies at high redshifts?

"* Problem: How can the morpho-kinematic properties of the most distant known galaxy, MACS1149-JD1, be analyzed and understood?

* Solution:
  * The researchers used new ALMA observations to spatially resolve the [OIII] 88 um line of the galaxy MACS1149-JD1. This provided the necessary data for a detailed analysis.
  * They conducted a morpho-kinematic analysis of the galaxy, which is a study of the shape and motion of the galaxy's components.

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used high-resolution observations of the [C II] 158um line emission obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to analyze the spatial distribution and kinematics of the cold ionized gas in the galaxy COS-2987030247.
  * They compared the spatial distribution and extension of the [C II] and rest-frame UV emission, and modeled the [C II] line data-cube.
  * The system was found to be composed of a main central source, a fainter north extension, and candidate [C II] companions located 10-kpc away.
  * The [C II] velocity map revealed a velocity gradient in the north-south direction suggesting ordered motion, as commonly found in rotating-disk galaxies.
  * If the rotating nature of the galaxy is confirmed, a low average velocity dispersion implies a dispersion lower than the expected value from observations and semi-analytic models of high redshift galaxies.

  * To address the complexity of heterogeneous, multi-wavelength and multi-telescope data, and angular-scale sensitive radio-interferometric images, the citizen science approach is modified to a research collaboratory of trained citizen scientists.
  * The citizen scientists are trained through a face-to-face training program hosted free-of-cost by various research institutes. The training is aimed at University-level science-educated citizens/students.
  * After the training, the citizen scientists continue interactive learning and discover exotic radio galaxies from their respective homes, primarily using free internet services.
  * The preliminary discoveries made by the citizen scientists are then followed up with the GMRT telescope.
  * The paper also suggests that the Big Data being created by new surveys is a Big Opportunity, if the Collaboratory approach to citizen science is adopted, which is considered a powerful medium for achieving Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations."
"* Problem: How can the star formation rate (SFR) of high redshift galaxies be accurately determined when the usual gas mass tracer, the carbon monoxide (CO) J=1-0 transition, shows non-detections or only marginal detections?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes to use data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) in the ultraviolet and optical bands to fit a spectral energy distribution (SED) for the sample of galaxies.
  * The SED fitting is used to constrain the star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxies.
  * Using the constrained SFR, the paper suggests creating predicted (CO) J=1-0 maps for the galaxies.
  * The predicted (CO) J=1-0 maps are then compared with the observational non-detections of the CO J=1-0 transition.
  * This comparison allows for a more accurate determination of the SFR of high redshift galaxies, even when the usual gas mass tracer is not detectable.
  * The paper suggests that this method could be used to refine the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, which relates the SFR of a galaxy to its molecular gas mass."
"* Problem: How do Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) affect the molecular gas reservoirs that fuel star formation in massive galaxies, particularly in the early universe?

"* Problem: How can the origin of strong CO absorptions in the Near-Infrared (NIR) spectrum of massive Early-Type Galaxies (ETGs) be accurately explained, given the contradiction between the long-believed explanation of intermediate-age stellar populations and the older populations inferred from optical range studies?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used the EMIR spectrograph at the Gran Telescopio Canarias, the largest telescope in the world operating in the NIR, to obtain the spectrum of the prototype of relic galaxies, NGC1277.
  * They compared the CO absorption features of NGC1277 with those of a representative sample of massive ETGs.
  * Through this comparison, they were able to assess the validity of the long-believed explanation of the origin of strong CO absorptions in the NIR spectrum of massive ETGs.
  * They found that the evidence for the explanation of intermediate-age stellar populations contributing substantially to the CO absorptions was not robust.
  * They ruled out the origin of CO-strong absorptions in massive ETGs as being due to intermediate-age stellar populations.
  * This finding provides a better way to reconcile the picture of galaxy formation and evolution in the NIR with the one from optical studies."
"* Problem: How do the most massive disk galaxies in the local Universe relate to their dark matter halos, particularly in terms of mass and angular momentum?

* Solution:
  * The researchers used new HI observations of a sample of very massive disk galaxies to derive extended HI rotation curves and mass models.
  * They obtained robust estimates of the halo masses of these galaxies.
  * They confirmed that these massive galaxies follow the Tully-Fisher relation (mass-velocity) and the Fall relation (angular momentum-mass), with no clear break or bend at the high-mass end.
  * They studied the connection between baryons and dark matter through the stellar-to-halo mass relation.
  * They found that massive disk galaxies systematically inhabit less massive halos than predicted by abundance matching prescriptions, and that the ratio of halo mass to stellar mass increases with mass and does not turn over at the high-mass end.
  * They also found that disks retain a significant fraction of the halo specific angular momentum, with little or no dependence on mass, indicating that disks are a self-similar population of objects closely linked to their dark matter halos.
  * Their findings suggest that, unlike massive spheroids, massive disks grow efficiently throughout cosmic time, without experiencing disruptive events like strong feedback and/or major mergers."

  * The structure of the thermal and nonthermal emission on kiloparsec scales is investigated.
  * The evolution of the thermal fraction and synchrotron spectrum at mid-radio frequencies is studied, with findings that the synchrotron spectrum flattens with redshift, causing curvature in the observed mid-radio SEDs of galaxies at higher redshifts.
  * The capability of the proposed SKA1-MID reference surveys in detecting the RC emitting structures is assessed. The survey is found to be capable of unveiling the interstellar medium in M51- and NGC6946-like galaxies up to a redshift of 3, but only detects lower-mass galaxies like M33 at low redshifts.
  * The paper suggests that for a proper separation of the RC emitting processes at the peak of star formation, it is vital to include band 1 into the SKA1-MID reference surveys."
"* Problem: How can the existence of dynamically cold disc galaxies at high redshifts (z > 4) be explained, given that current galaxy formation models predict chaotic systems due to factors such as gas accretion, mergers, and efficient feedback?

* Solution:

  * The study identifies evidence of radial motions in all galaxies, which could be attributed to minor mergers or gas accretion.
  * The research finds that all galaxies host regularly rotating discs with gas velocity dispersions significantly lower than those predicted by current cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The ratios of ordered-to-random motions (V/sigma) range from 2.6 to 9.
  * The thickness of the gas discs is estimated, revealing that they are of the order of 1 kpc, similar to the thick discs of local galaxies like the Milky Way.
  * The findings suggest that dynamically cold discs can form earlier than previously thought, challenging existing galaxy formation models.
  * The study proposes that some thick discs could be formed in-situ in the early stages of galaxy formation, providing a potential explanation for the observed phenomena."
"* Problem: How can the dynamics of high redshift galaxies be accurately studied to provide insights into their formation, assembly, and the constraints on galaxy formation models?

  * The paper acknowledges that current dynamical studies of high-z galaxies have been obtained mainly using warm gas tracers such as Halpha, [OII], [OIII].
  * It points out that these warm gas tracers may be strongly affected by non-circular motions driven by inflows, outflows, and mergers.
  * The paper implies the need for further research or alternative methods to account for the impact of these non-circular motions on the study of high redshift galaxies."
"* Problem: How is the spatial distribution of mm-wavelength dust emission from galaxies, specifically the grand design spiral galaxy NGC6946, characterized and what role does it play in the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium?

  * Leverage Cholla's ability to simulate down to dx<5 pc at a fixed resolution across its entire simulation volume, to capture the detailed structures of the interstellar medium (ISM) and galactic outflows simultaneously.
  * Use Cholla's successful simulations of disk galaxies with star formation feedback-driven outflows to understand how cool clouds can survive in these hot outflows by resolving the mixing layer between wind phases.
  * Investigate the survival of dust in these hot winds, which originates in the late stages of stellar evolution in the ISM, but is often observed in the circumgalactic media (CGMs) of galaxies.
  * Explore the possibility of winds being responsible for transporting dust out of galaxies, despite the high likelihood of dust destruction in hot gas.
  * Develop and implement a self-consistent dust model in Cholla to gain new insight into the viability of this transport mechanism, and the conditions under which dust can survive in outflows."
"* Problem: How does the dust continuum morphology of high redshift galaxies contribute to our understanding of galaxy evolution and obscured star formation?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of the ALMA large program, CRISTAL, to measure the dust size of ""typical"" star-forming galaxies at high redshifts (z=4-6).
  * The researchers utilize high-resolution and deep ALMA observations to accurately measure the dust continuum size of less-dusty UV-selected galaxies at these high redshifts.

  * The researchers calculate the surface FIR densities of these galaxies, finding them to be comparable with that of the extended components of the SMGs.
  * The paper concludes that normal star-forming galaxies are forming their disks through widespread star formation, in contrast to massive DSFGs, which show compact star formation in their central part."
"* Problem: How does the orientation of filamentary structures in the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions across the Milky Way galaxy vary with respect to the Galactic plane and what are the potential causes of these variations?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used observations from the HI4PI survey across the Galactic plane and the THOR survey in the first Galactic quadrant to study the filamentary structure in the HI emission at 21 cm.
  * They found that in the Milky Way’s disk regions beyond ten kpc and up to roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic center, HI filamentary structures are predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane.
  * However, in regions at lower Galactocentric radii, the HI filaments are mostly perpendicular or do not have a preferred orientation with respect to the Galactic plane.
  * These results are interpreted as the imprint of supernova feedback in the inner Galaxy and Galactic rotation and shear in the outer Milky Way.
  * The researchers also studied the CO emission observations obtained in the MWISP survey and found that the orientations of the filamentary structures traced by CO emission differed from those found in the HI emission.
  * This difference is considered to indicate that the molecular structures do not simply inherit these properties from parental atomic clouds, but are shaped by local physical conditions, such as stellar feedback and magnetic fields."

"* Problem: How is stellar mass built up over time in massive disk galaxies during the epoch of Cosmic Noon, particularly in the context of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs)?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of submillimeter surveys to define samples of gravitationally-lensed DSFGs at z=1-4 (and beyond). These surveys help identify extreme objects with IR luminosities of 10^12 -10^14 L_sun that form stars at rates of 100 – 3000 M_sun/yr.
  * The study focuses on the most luminous DSFGs, defined through PASSAGES: the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts. This helps in identifying DSFGs that show evidence for widespread star formation in clumps distributed throughout the rotating disks.
  * The paper suggests the use of ALMA’s 0.1-0.5” spatial resolution, combined with additional magnification provided by lensing, to map the gas kinematics at sub-kpc scales. This allows for careful dynamical modeling of CO, which is usually only accessible in the local Universe.
  * The study proposes the use of dust continuum from ALMA and the distribution of existing stars provided by Hubble to view active star formation. This helps in constructing a picture of how stellar mass is built up over time in massive disk galaxies.
  * Finally, the paper discusses leveraging sensitive near-IR imaging from JWST to reveal regions of galaxies that are heavily reddened and attenuated by dust. This, in combination with ALMA, can advance our understanding of disks in the early Universe."
"* Problem: What are the origins and evolution of dust properties in local analogues, and how do these properties contribute to the variety of extinction curves observed in galaxies today?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of an on-the-fly dust evolution model combined with state of the art cosmological zooms to investigate the origin and evolution of dust properties in local analogues.
  * The SMUGGLE interstellar medium and stellar feedback model is utilized for the moving mesh code AREPO in the simulations. This model helps in understanding the interaction between dust and the interstellar medium.

  * The grain sizes are additionally reshaped via grain-grain collisions including shattering and coagulation. This aspect helps in understanding the changes in dust properties over time.
  * The simulations facilitate the study on the potential drivers that lead to a variety of extinction curves in galaxies today. This helps in understanding the impact of dust on the light extinction in galaxies."
"* Problem: How can we accurately study and measure the gas and star formations in high redshift galaxies, specifically in the galaxy SDSS J0901+1814?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to use the continuum emission analysis for the galaxy SDSS J0901+1814, a strongly lensed main sequence star-forming galaxy at redshift 2.26.
  * The researchers obtained the galaxy's continuum emission at 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz from VLA (L and S band). These observations were conducted at both A and B configurations for S-band and A configuration for the L-band, resulting in ~1’’ spatial resolution at both wavelengths.
  * The flux distribution for all three lensed arcs was successfully resolved using the above method.
  * The researchers used previously observed VLA 35 GHz emission to fit out a spectral index at the S-band of about -0.2. This led to an unobscured star formation rate measurement of 142 M⦿/year, consistent with the prediction from the Hα+TIR combined tracer.
  * The paper also proposes the use of the new tclean tool provided in CASA to furnish a pixel-by-pixel measurement on spectral indices. The measurement in different regions was discussed with a Gaussian smoothing technique implemented on both the alpha and error maps.
  * Finally, the paper concludes that J0901 is free-free emission dominated at S-band. At small scales, however, the enormous energy output is due to synchrotron emission from AGN activities, which steepens the spectral indices to about -2."
"* Problem: What is the origin of the higher fraction of elliptical galaxies in galaxy clusters in the present universe compared to low-density environments?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to study the active phase of star formation in high-redshift clusters to understand the environmental effect on the formation of elliptical galaxies.
  * The researchers use spatially resolved CO J=2–1 line and 870 μm continuum observations of cluster galaxies in XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z = 1.46, obtained from ALMA.
  * The sample comprises 17 CO emitters within approximately 0.5 Mpc from the cluster center. The effective radii of both CO J=2–1 line and 870 μm dust continuum emissions are measured for nine galaxies.
  * The paper finds that the CO J=2–1 line emission in all of the nine galaxies is more extended than the dust continuum emission by a factor of 2.8 ± 1.4.
  * The spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation for the sample reveals that the central region of galaxies tends to have a shorter gas depletion timescale, i.e., a higher star formation efficiency (SFE), compared to the extended region.
  * The paper suggests that star formation activities are concentrated inside the extended gas reservoir, possibly resulting in the formation of a bulge structure.
  * The paper also presents the recent result of gas kinematics using CO J=2-1 line. The rotation velocity of the cluster galaxies indicates that the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is smaller than the Galactic value."

"* Problem: How can we understand the structure, properties, and dynamics of individual galaxies from the Epoch of Reionization, and determine the dominant process contributing to galaxy growth?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes to study a 'normal' star-forming galaxy, UVISTA-Z-019, selected as a Lyman break galaxy confirmed at redshift z=6.75, to understand the physics of galaxy formation and evolution at early times.
  * The study uses high-resolution kinematic analysis to investigate the contribution of mergers and smooth gas accretion to galaxy growth.

"* Problem: How can the distinct, orthogonal rotation signatures of globular clusters in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy be explained and what do they imply about the galaxy's accretion history?

* Solution: 
  * The paper first identifies the existence of two distinct populations of globular clusters in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy, half of which are associated with stellar substructures and the other half are not.
  * A kinematic analysis of these two populations is conducted, revealing distinct, orthogonal rotation signatures. This suggests that these two populations were formed from two separate accretion events.
  * The paper proposes that these two accretion events were not simultaneous, but rather one was ancient and the other more recent.
  * The implications of these findings are explored, suggesting that the distinct rotation signatures and their associated accretion events provide insight into the formation and evolution of the Andromeda galaxy.
  * A new analysis of the inner globular clusters of Andromeda is presented, finding that the kinematics of the outer halo are imprinted on this inner sample.
  * This imprinting provides further evidence for the paper's hypothesis of distinct accretion events, reinforcing the conclusion that the Andromeda galaxy's halo was formed through separate, distinct accretion events."

"* Problem: How can the formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way, particularly the origin of M 22 and its relationship with the in-situ component Aurora, be explained?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes that the chemical abundances found in M 22, a stellar system, are similar to those of an accreted dwarf galaxy, suggesting it may have been part of the formation of the Milky Way.
  * The authors suggest that the enhancement of slow neutron-capture (S-)process elements in M 22 is due to pollution from low-mass AGB stars, a theory that is not universally accepted but is supported by their research.
  * The paper introduces the concept of Aurora, the in-situ component of the Milky Way, which is believed to be the precursor to the Milky Way disk. This component is found to be enhanced in s-process elements compared to other chemical structures at similar metallicity.
  * The authors draw a link between the original in-situ stars of the Milky Way (Aurora) and the formation of M 22, based on their similar chemical enhancements.
  * The paper suggests that M 22 may be coeval (of the same age) with Aurora, based on high precision chemical abundance measurements.
  * The authors propose that studying the formation mechanisms of this s-process population can provide insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way before the establishment of the disk."
"* Problem: How can the initial conditions that give rise to Globular Clusters (GCs) be determined, particularly in relation to the potential existence of a subdominant population of primordial GCs?

* Solution: 
  * The paper applies parameterized models of primordial GC formation to Extended Press-Schechter merger trees, a method used to predict the statistical properties of the distribution of dark matter halos.
  * The researchers attempt to constrain the allowed parameter space for these models through a statistical comparison to the observed relation between cluster number and halo mass.
  * A new version of the halo mass relation is introduced, derived by extrapolating the trend of cluster counts with stellar mass to large galaxy group catalogues.

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to study the chemical composition of the old M31 disk using the JWST/NIRSPEC. 
  * The goal is to obtain the abundances of Fe, C, N, and O for hundreds of M31 old disk giants, which will help in understanding the history of star formation and mass assembly of the M31 disk.
  * The paper aims to contrast the properties of the M31 disk with those of the Milky Way disk, particularly focusing on the ""alpha bimodality"" - the existence of two populations with distinct values of the ratio between the abundances of alpha elements and iron.
  * The paper will test theoretical predictions that pose the alpha bimodality as a consequence of general disk galaxy physics, and also the contention of cosmological numerical simulations that link the alpha-bimodality with an intense star formation episode associated with a vigorous early accretion history.
  * The paper will use a combination of NIRCAM photometry and NIRSPEC spectroscopy to constrain the presence of an alpha-bimodality in one disk field located 1.5 scale lengths from the centre of M31.

  * The paper proposes to use the abundance pattern characteristic of second generation GC populations as a tracer for GC disruption.
  * The SDSS/APOGEE survey is used to detect a large population of second generation GC stars in the Galactic halo field.
  * The contribution of GC disruption to the halo stellar mass is estimated, showing a variation from a few percent at Rgc ~ 10 kpc to approximately ~25% within the inner 2 kpc of the Galactic centre.
  * The incidence of second generation GC stars in all components of the Milky Way, and its Local Group dwarf companions, is evaluated based on the 17th data release of the APOGEE 2 survey.
  * The constraints posed by these measurements on models of the formation and destruction of globular clusters are discussed.

"* Problem: How can the chemical properties of stars in the tidal tails of globular clusters be understood to shed light on the role of these clusters in the structure formation of the Milky Way?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used Gaia data to search for a tidal tail around the globular cluster M92, a cluster of stars in the Hercules constellation.
  * They applied a matched filter algorithm to the color-magnitude diagram of M92, which resulted in the discovery of a tidal tail with a length of 6 degrees.
  * The team then used APOGEE data to investigate the chemical properties of stars in the identified tidal tail.
  * They applied the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to the APOGEE chemical data to select cluster member stars, which allowed them to separate globular cluster member stars from field stars in a 2-dimensional map.
  * Among the 82 identified cluster member stars, 12 were found in the extended stellar halo and along the tidal tail of M92.
  * Particularly, 7 extra-tidal stars showed apparent Al-enhanced and Mg-depleted chemical features, suggesting that these stars could be ejected second-generation stars from M92, indicating that some stars in the Galactic halo may have originated from the tidal disruption of globular clusters."
"* Problem: How does the scatter between stellar mass and viral mass contribute to the diversity of stellar halo properties in low-mass disk galaxies?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes to use simulations of the stellar halos of low-mass disk galaxies, ranging from the mass of the LMC to the mass of M33, to study the diversity of stellar halo properties.

  * Finally, the paper introduces the public release of particle data from the simulations, which can be used for further research and validation."
"* Problem: How can the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies, which are poorly constrained due to limited data on the chemical compositions of their constituent stars, be better understood?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of state-of-the-art cosmological numerical simulations to provide statistically significant samples of realistic chemistry of stellar populations for galaxies in a range of masses and environments.
  * The distribution of the stars in the [alpha/fe]-[fe/h] plane, characterized by the presence of an [alpha/Fe] plateau at low metallicity and a decreasing sequence at higher metallicity, is used as a diagnostic of the star formation history of a stellar system.
  * The paper investigates the common belief that the metallicity of the alpha-knee is correlated with galaxy mass, using predictions from the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations.
  * The analysis of the knee metallicity-galaxy mass relation for both central and satellite galaxies spanning a broad stellar mass range at z=0 reveals a strong relation between total stellar mass and metallicity of the knee [Fe/H]_knee.
  * The paper finds that alpha-knees are not caused simply by the onset of Type Ia supernovae, but due to a combination of the latter and a strong decline in the star formation rate.
  * The paper also explores the dependence of the scatter in the M* - [Fe/H]_knee relation on important galactic parameters such as formation time and assembly history, which is associated with the duration of the peak of the star formation history."

  * The paper explores the formation and settling of the stellar and gaseous disks of these galaxies, and compares the importance of disk settling versus post-formation heating in determining the observable relationship between stellar kinematics and stellar age today.
  * It examines the formation histories of the satellite galaxies in these simulations, demonstrating that the current satellite population is a highly incomplete representation of the progenitor population that formed the Local Group.
  * The paper quantifies how well the stellar populations of surviving low-mass galaxies serve as fossil records of the overall galaxy population at high redshifts (z > 6), to inform the use of galactic archeology in probing the epoch of reionization."
"* Problem: How can a model be developed that accurately represents the evolution of dwarf galaxies, accounting for a wide range of observed properties over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a simple model for the evolution of dwarf galaxies that can reproduce a broad range of observed properties of these galaxies.
  * The model is used to forward model the population of the Milky Way's satellites down to the faintest luminosities observed, taking into account observational selection effects, effects of disk disruption, and effects of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
  * The model demonstrates that the observed luminosity function favors early reionization of the local volume, suggesting an early stage of the universe when the first stars ionized neutral hydrogen.
  * The model can reproduce the radial distribution of the Milky Way's satellites without the use of orphans, which are galaxies without a dark matter halo.
  * The paper uses the model to analyze a sample of Milky Way-sized halos, showing that the observed planar distribution of the Milky Way's satellites and the correlation of their orbital poles is somewhat unusual.
  * Despite this unusual distribution, the model shows that it is statistically consistent with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model, the leading theory of the formation and evolution of galaxies and large-scale structure in the universe."
"* Problem: How can we better understand the early stages of galactic and chemical evolution in the universe, particularly in the context of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) like Tucana II?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to study the detailed chemical abundances of stars in the outskirts of the Tucana II UFD, extending the focus beyond the core region of these galaxies where previous studies have been concentrated.
  * The researchers identify a population of stars outside the core region of Tucana II that appear to be bound to the galaxy, marking the first detailed abundance analysis of such a population.
  * The paper finds that these distant stars are more metal-poor than the central population, suggesting that Tucana II is the most metal-poor known UFD.
  * The difference in metallicity between the inner and outer stars suggests that Tucana II, and potentially other UFDs, were influenced by early, strong feedback or a galactic merger.
  * The alpha-element abundances in Tucana II indicate some delayed chemical evolution, consistent with the galaxy being formed by an early merger of two first galaxies that triggered star formation.
  * The presence of these distant stars also implies that Tucana II harbors a massive, spatially extended dark matter halo, providing further insights into the early evolution of relic dwarf galaxies."
"* Problem: How can the formation of low surface brightness dwarf galaxies, which present challenges to galaxy formation theory and potential constraints on the nature of dark matter, be explained?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a new formation mechanism called the 'ghost galaxy' scenario. In this scenario, inefficient radiative cooling prevents star formation in the dominant dark matter potential of low mass halos, leading to the acquisition of almost all their stellar mass through mergers.
  * The authors use merger trees based on the Extended Press-Schechter formalism and the CoCo cosmological N-body simulation to demonstrate that mass assembly histories of this kind do occur for low-mass halos in lambda CDM.
  * The paper identifies that these 'ghost galaxy' scenarios are most probable in isolated halos of present-day mass 4 x 10^9 M_sun, occurring for 5 per cent of all halos of that mass.
  * The authors acknowledge that the stellar masses of the star-forming progenitors in these systems are highly uncertain. However, they use abundance-matching arguments to imply a bimodal present-day mass function having a brighter population.
  * The paper also discusses the sensitivity of this result to assumptions about cosmic reionization and the dark matter particle mass."
"* Problem: How does the process of accretion of gas followed by star formation result in the creation of kinematically peculiar galaxies with two counter-rotating stellar discs?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to study these peculiar galaxies to understand the amount of material, the time, and the method of falling onto the progenitor galaxy.
  * The researchers use publicly available data from the SDSS MaNGA DR17 survey to identify a sample of 56 counter-rotating galaxies in the MaNGA IFU survey.
  * They initiate a follow-up observational campaign at the 6-m BTA telescope to determine the stellar population properties of both stellar discs in these galaxies.
  * The preliminary results suggest a dichotomy in the sample of counter-rotating galaxies.
  * The paper finds that the most massive galaxies have extended counter-rotating disks whose contribution to luminosity is higher than in the less massive galaxies.
  * This suggests different evolutionary paths for these galaxies, providing insight into the process of their formation."
"* Problem: How does the evolution of the Milky Way galaxy align with modern observations of the high-z universe, particularly in relation to the structure, kinematics, and chemical composition of galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to combine new analytic models, such as those by Sharda et al. 2021 and Leaman et al. 2022, with high redshift surveys of molecular and ionised gas. This combination will provide a comprehensive approach to understanding galaxy evolution.
  * The study will use local galactic and extragalactic archeology studies to gain further insight into the evolutionary history of local galaxies, including the Milky Way.
  * The paper will present results that show how the majority of 'normal' star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon host thick disk-like structures and a turbulent gas-rich interstellar medium.
  * The study will also discuss new CII observations that reveal possibly cold disks at cosmic dawn, and how this relates to the state-of-the-art models of the Milky Way's past.
  * The paper will examine how the resolved abundance patterns of disks are evolving, with radial gradients being subdominant at early times.
  * The paper will discuss observational results within the framework of theoretical models for the formation of the local stellar age-velocity dispersion relation, the size-scale height relation, and history of metallicity gradients in local group galaxies."
"* Problem: What causes the formation of the Vast Polar Structure (VPOS), a large planar structure observed in the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and other galaxies?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes that the formation of the VPOS is not unique to the Milky Way but is a result of general galaxy physics.
  * The author conducts a numerical calculation to identify the conditions that would reproduce the stable orbits of particles consistent with the observed VPOS.
  * The calculation is based on the figure rotation of the Milky Way's halo, suggesting that the rotation of the galaxy's halo may play a role in the formation of the VPOS.
  * The results of the calculation indicate that a stable orbital plane with precession around the rotating axis appears within a rotating potential model.
  * This suggests that the VPOS may be formed by the stable orbits of particles within a rotating potential model, providing a potential explanation for the formation of the VPOS."
"* Problem: How does the distribution of Dark Matter (DM) in the halo of merging galaxies affect the motion and resistance against tidal disruption of their sub-components, such as satellite systems, star clusters, and dwarf galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The paper analyzes the radial DM density distribution of two merging galaxies from a merger simulation by Yang et al. (2014) in a temporal sequence after the merger event.
  * The snapshots of the DM distribution are compared with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile of a relaxed halo, which is generally assumed for massive galaxy halos.
  * The paper finds that the relaxation of the DM halo takes much longer than the numerical simulation runs and the merger event is still evident even after 6.5 Gyrs by an anisotropic DM distribution.
  * The DM distribution becomes flat in the orbital plane of the merging galaxies, while the vertical DM stratification survives close to NFW.
  * The paper concludes that former satellites are affected by the anisotropic DM distribution in two ways: i) the gravitational binding in the orbital plane decreases, facilitating those satellites on orbits close to the plane to escape from the merger, while satellites on polar orbits become more closely bound. ii) The tidal force of the merger remnant acts differently on satellites.
  * The paper suggests that numerical simulations of satellites and TDGs fail when implying a spherical static NFW profile due to the anisotropic DM distribution."
"* Problem: How can the star formation histories and the presence of old stellar populations in the outer regions of local grand design spiral galaxies be accurately determined and interpreted?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers collected a sample of eight local grand design spirals from the Dustpedia database for detailed photometric analysis.
  * They performed a spatially resolved study down to spatial scales of approximately 0.5Kpc, using data from the UV (GALEX) up to the far-Infrared (Herschel).
  * They applied an SED fitting procedure that accounts for the obscured star formation processes, using a Bayesian approach (BAGPIPES).
  * They reconstructed the average star formation histories over the different regions of each galaxy, from the central bulges up to the very outskirts of the spiral structures.
  * They reported the detection of old stellar populations symmetrically surrounding the galaxies in the most external regions of the disks.
  * They discussed possible interpretations of these findings, accounting for both in-situ and ex-situ scenarios."
"* Problem: How can the observed deficiency of dark matter in certain dwarf galaxies be explained?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to examine dwarf galaxies in the SPARC and LITTLE THINGS catalogs to identify if any of them are dark matter deficient.
  * The EAGLE simulation galaxies are used as a reference, assuming that their conditions describe the expected conditions for the observed galaxies.
  * The paper identifies three dark matter deficient galaxies, IC 1613, DDO 50, and UGC 7125, as outliers in the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, indicating a higher galaxy formation efficiency and different rotation curves compared to the simulated galaxies.
  * The paper considers distance uncertainty as a potential cause for the observed dark matter deficiency, but concludes that this is not a conclusive explanation for UGC 7125, and not applicable for IC 1613 and DDO 50.
  * The paper also considers the inclination of IC 1613 as a potential cause for the observed dark matter deficiency, but concludes that this is not a conclusive explanation.
  * The paper examines the tidal radii of the sibling galaxies, but finds no indication of stripping as a potential cause for the observed dark matter deficiency.
  * The paper finally suggests that gas disturbance through ram pressure stripping by the hot gas in the galaxy cluster could be a potential cause for the observed dark matter deficiency in DDO 50, and that the HI disk of UGC 7125 warps."
"* Problem: How do the formations of satellite galaxy planes around massive galaxies differ between the fuzzy dark matter model and the cold dark matter model?

* Solution: 
  * The paper first establishes the theoretical framework for both the fuzzy dark matter model and the cold dark matter model, explaining the key differences between the two.
  * The authors then conduct a numerical comparison between the two models, focusing specifically on the formations of satellite galaxy planes around massive galaxies.
  * The paper demonstrates that satellite galaxies in the fuzzy dark matter model have a tendency to form more flattened and corotating satellite systems than in the cold dark matter model.
  * This difference is attributed to the dissipation by the gravitational cooling effect of the fuzzy dark matter, a unique characteristic of this model.
  * The authors further validate their findings by comparing their results with observational data, showing a good match between the predictions of the fuzzy dark matter model and the observed properties of satellite galaxies.
  * The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for our understanding of dark matter and galaxy formation, suggesting that the fuzzy dark matter model may provide a more accurate description of the universe."
"* Problem: How can the discrepancy between observed planes of dwarf satellites around local galaxies and the rarity of such planes in numerical simulations, which challenges the accepted Lambda CDM cosmology, be resolved?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes simulating a larger volume to better capture the inflow along cosmic filaments, while maintaining small-scale resolution across this volume.
  * The authors use the New Horizon simulation to test their proposed solution.
  * The simulation results show that approximately 30% of Milky Way-type systems have satellite planes, which is significantly higher than the less than 2% found in previous simulations.
  * This finding resolves the conflict between observations and simulations, supporting the Lambda CDM cosmology.
  * The paper also discusses potential origins of these satellite planes.
  * The authors suggest that these planes may provide a new perspective on the dynamics of the Local Universe."
"* Problem: How can we understand the variation in key physical processes of disk formation in galaxies and their evolution?

  * The GECKOS sample includes 35 nearby, edge-on disk galaxies, chosen to determine the assembly histories and properties of galaxies across a large range of SFRs, B/T ratios, and boxy and non-boxy bulges.
  * The paper presents the survey’s first few months of IFS data, with 2D measurements of stellar abundance, age, and kinematics, as well as ionised gas metallicities, ionisation parameters, and outflow kinematics.
  * The data collected will be used to extend Galactic methods to the wider galaxy population, leveraging the benefits of detailed Milky Way studies, while probing the diverse mechanisms of galaxy evolution."

"* Problem: How can the existence of low-mass galaxies lacking dark matter be explained within the standard cold dark matter plus cosmological constant model?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes that the standard cosmological model can naturally produce galaxies lacking dark matter, contrary to previous concerns.
  * The researchers use FIREbox, a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation based on the 'Feedback In Realistic Environments' (FIRE) model, to support their hypothesis.
  * They employ a meticulous galaxy-identification technique to identify galaxies lacking dark matter within the simulation.
  * The paper suggests that extreme close encounters with massive neighbouring galaxies can result in the observed lack of dark matter in certain low-mass galaxies.
  * The researchers predict that about 30% of massive central galaxies harbour at least one dark-matter-deficient satellite.
  * The paper concludes that this distinctive class of galaxies provides an additional layer in our understanding of the role of interactions and tidal stripping in shaping galactic properties. Future observations with facilities like the Rubin and JWST will provide a crucial test of this scenario."
"* Problem: How can we identify stars that accreted from the smallest dwarf galaxies, known as ultra faint dwarfs (UFDs), to better understand the low-mass end of the Milky Way's assembly history?

* Solution: 
  * Utilize the Caterpillar simulation suite, a set of 35 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies forming, to study the accretion of stars from UFDs.
  * Implement chemical tagging with r-process elements to identify stars that accreted from UFDs. This method is based on the idea that stars from the same dwarf galaxy should have similar chemical compositions.
  * Use clustering in kinematic phase space to further identify stars that accreted together from these dwarf galaxies. This method is based on the idea that stars from the same dwarf galaxy should have similar motions.
  * Expand on this work with highly-resolved hydrodynamic simulations of the earliest dwarf galaxies to quantify the low-mass end of the Milky Way assembly history.
  * Identify stars from UFDs that still exist in the Local Group, as these stars are particularly important for understanding early galaxy formation and chemical enrichment.
  * Overcome the limitation that even the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) cannot directly observe these low-mass high-redshift galaxies by focusing on the identification of stars from UFDs in the Local Group."

"* Problem: How can the internal stellar orbit distribution and the age and metallicity of different orbital structures in galaxies be accurately determined and compared with simulations?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of a novel population-orbit superposition method applied to IFU data to obtain a galaxy’s internal stellar orbit distribution, as well as the age and metallicity of different orbital structures.
  * The method is applied to hundreds of CALIFA, MaNGA and Fornax 3D galaxies observed by MUSE/VLT, allowing for direct comparisons of galaxy structures with simulations.
  * For galaxies in the field, the stellar orbit distribution of Illustris TNG50 galaxies is found to match that of the CALIFA galaxies remarkably well, particularly in the fractions of dynamical cold/hot orbits as a function of galaxy mass in the range of 10^9.5 -10^12 Msun.
  * For galaxies in the Fornax cluster, it is found that recent infallers have similar stellar orbit distribution to the field galaxies, while ancient infallers have much lower fractions of dynamically cold orbits for galaxies in all mass ranges, a trend also found in TNG50 cluster galaxies.
  * The stellar orbit distribution provides a clean interface for quantitatively investigating the origin of galactic structures from simulations, due to the remarkable agreements between observations and simulations.
  * The paper shows how the combination of secure evolution and mergers lead to the stellar orbit distribution in present-day galaxies from TNG50."
"* Problem: The paper seeks to understand the cause of the kinematic asymmetry observed in the isolated gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxy WLM in the Local Group.

* Solution: 
  * The paper first proposes the possibility of an m = 1 perturbation in the halo potential as a mechanism causing the kinematic asymmetry in the galaxy.
  * The researchers fit a theoretical rotational velocity associated with an m = 1 perturbation in the halo potential model to the observed data to test this hypothesis.
  * The results show that the lopsided halo potential model can reasonably explain the observed kinematic asymmetry.
  * The paper also explores the kinematical classification of the velocity field of WLM using various methods.
  * Based on a kinemetry analysis, the researchers find that WLM could potentially lie in a transition region where the disk and merger coexist.
  * The paper concludes that a merger could be one of the possible origins of the dark matter halo lopsidedness for this isolated galaxy."
"* Problem: How can we better understand the complex assembly history of the Milky Way, particularly in relation to high-ratio mass mergers and the role of dark matter halos?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of the Auriga project, a suite of thirty cosmological-zoom simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, to investigate the diversity of Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE) analogues.
  * The study focuses on the kinematics and chemical properties of these GSE analogues both before and after they fall into the Milky Way.
  * The paper predicts signals of high-redshift accretions, which could help identify major merger events even when chemo-dynamical analyses are insufficient.
  * The study explores the diversity and luminosity functions of the satellite populations associated with these merging galaxies, suggesting that some satellites may appear as independent merger events.
  * The paper proposes that distinct populations of stellar debris could be related to the same progenitor, providing a new perspective on the assembly history of the Milky Way.
  * The study also considers the few surviving satellite galaxies and investigates whether these can be distinguished from the overall satellite population, providing further insight into the complex assembly history of the Milky Way."
"* Problem: How can we determine the halo masses at which we can expect a predominantly rotationally supported dwarf galaxy and at which masses we should expect spheroidal objects from the beginning?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to use numerical simulations as a method to investigate the formation of dwarf galaxies.
  * The researchers will simulate the formation of dwarf disc galaxies of higher masses and their subsequent destruction to form dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
  * The simulations will be used to identify the halo masses at which a predominantly rotationally supported dwarf galaxy is formed.
  * The simulations will also be used to identify the halo masses at which we should expect spheroidal objects from the beginning.
  * The results of the simulations will be compared with the standard cosmological picture of galaxy formation to validate or challenge the existing theories.
  * The findings will contribute to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, particularly the role of halo masses in the formation of different types of galaxies."
"* Problem: How can the estimation of dark matter distribution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies be improved, given the persistent issue of mass-anisotropy degeneracy in second-order Jeans analysis?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the extension of spherical Jeans modeling by incorporating fourth-order velocity moments, under the assumption of dynamical equilibrium and a constant velocity anisotropy.
  * This inclusion allows the stars' line-of-sight (l.o.s) velocity distribution to be flexible, covering thin-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions, which is not possible with only second-order moments.
  * The researchers test their stellar dynamical modeling using mock data that resembles Draco dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies with either a central Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) cusp or a Burkert core and isotropic velocity anisotropy.
  * The simulations are conducted using 500 sample stars to ensure a robust and representative dataset.
  * The results show that incorporating fourth-order velocity moments significantly improves the estimation of dark matter distribution compared to when only second-order moments are used.
  * Specifically, the velocity anisotropy is constrained two times better, and there is a ~50% improvement for the constraint of the inner dark matter density slope, with both parameters being recovered within 1σ uncertainties."
"* Problem: How can the unusual kinematic properties of satellite galaxies in the Local Group, which are not replicated in cosmological simulations, be explained?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes that the observed co-rotation patterns of satellite galaxies are linked to the out-of-equilibrium state of the galaxy, a natural explanation that does not depend on the nature of the Dark Matter particle and in baryonic processes.
  * It uses data from recent missions and surveys, such as Gaia, to show that the Milky Way galaxy is not in dynamical equilibrium, with the barycenter of the galaxy moving due to ongoing interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.
  * The paper uses the Latte hydrodynamical high-resolution zoom-in simulation of Milky Way-like galaxies to demonstrate how a massive satellite can shift the reference frame of the inner halo relative to the outer halo, resulting in apparent co-rotation motions of the outer halo when observed from the disk of the galaxies.
  * It shows how the distribution of orbital poles of outer halo objects is strongly affected during the pericenter passages.
  * The paper discusses what properties of the mergers, mass ratios, pericenter passages, and eccentricities, would be needed to reproduce the observational co-rotations pattern observed in the Milky Way and M31.
  * The paper emphasizes the importance of considering the dynamic state of the Local Group when comparing it with Local Group analogs in cosmological simulations."
"* Problem: How can the orientation of the minor axis of the Milky Way's Dark Matter halo be accurately determined?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a method to constrain the orientation of the minor axis of the Dark Matter halo, which is complementary to traditional techniques like orbit fitting.
  * The method is first tested using a simulated tidal stream evolving in a realistic environment inside a Milky Way-mass host from the FIRE cosmological simulation.
  * The theoretical description of a stream in the action-angle-frequency formalism is shown to hold for a realistic dwarf galaxy stream in a cosmological potential.
  * The slopes of the line in angle and frequency space are utilized, demonstrating that the correct rotation frame yields a minimal slope difference, which allows for a constraint on the minor axis location.
  * The method is then applied to the Sagittarius stream's leading arm, providing a constraint on the minor axis location.
  * The paper concludes that the Milky Way's Dark Matter halo is oblate with a specific flattening parameter and the minor axis pointing in a certain direction. The constraint on the minor axis location is weak and disagrees with estimates from other works, which the authors attribute to observational uncertainties and the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud."
"* Problem: How does the evolution of the Universe's metal abundance over cosmic time affect the thermodynamic behavior of interstellar gas and subsequently the characteristic mass that sets the peak of the stellar initial mass function (IMF)?

* Solution: 
  * The paper studies the gas thermodynamics in collapsing dusty molecular clouds at a wide range of metallicities, from primordial-like to super-Solar like, in different interstellar medium (ISM) conditions.
  * It identifies a transition from a primordial regime dominated by the competition between compressional heating and molecular hydrogen cooling to a modern regime where the dominant process in dense gas is protostellar radiation feedback, transmitted to the gas by dust–gas collisions.
  * The transition begins at metallicity Z ∼ 0.0001 Z, passes through an intermediate stage where metal line cooling is dominant, and then transitions to the modern dust- and feedback-dominated regime at Z ∼ 0.05 Z.
  * This transition is accompanied by a dramatic change in the characteristic stellar mass, from ∼50Msun at Z ∼ 10−6 Z to ∼0.3Msun once radiation feedback begins to dominate, which marks the appearance of the bottom-heavy Milky Way IMF.
  * The exact transition from top- to bottom-heavy IMF occurs at intermediate metallicities, and is sensitive to the adopted abundances of elements like C and O, which observations of both metal-poor stars and H II regions in metal-poor dwarf galaxies show is non-Solar-scaled.
  * The paper concludes by revealing the impact of the IMF on our understanding of the metal-poor Universe, bridging the gap between the stellar and galaxy communities."
"* Problem: How do the four major physical processes - gas accretion from the cosmic web, feedback due to star formation and supernovae, gas transport due to gravitational instabilities and torques, and galactic outflows - impact the evolution of galactic discs and the spatially-resolved gas-phase metal distribution in galaxies?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes a new semi-analytic model developed from first principles to study the relative importance of the four major physical processes that impact the evolution of galactic discs.
  * The model includes a comprehensive treatment of these processes by considering their effects on the mass, energy, and metal budget of galactic discs, which is a contrast to earlier work.
  * The paper demonstrates that to explain trends in ISM metallicities at z = 0, feedback and accretion must dominate over transport. This also explains the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and trends in gas velocity dispersions with star formation rates.
  * At high redshifts, the role of transport becomes dominant over feedback in setting the ISM metal distribution and metallicity gradients.
  * The paper shows that outflows play a significant role in shaping the metallicity gradients in low mass galaxies at all redshifts, but massive galaxies show shallower gradients regardless of the metal enrichment of outflows.
  * The paper suggests that upcoming JWST data of high-redshift galaxies will provide a crucial benchmark against which models like theirs can be tested, providing critical constraints on metallicities of galactic winds and the role of accretion and feedback in driving turbulence in galactic discs."
"* Problem: How can the shape of the galaxy Ultraviolet Luminosity Function (UVLF) at the faint end during the Epoch of Reionisation be accurately determined, given the limitations of current deep-field lensing surveys?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a ""near-far"" approach that uses the stellar fossil record (star formation histories) of Local Group dwarf galaxies to measure the faint end of the high-redshift UVLF.
  * The researchers use the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations to test key uncertainties in the near-far method that might bias inferences of the UVLF at z > 6.
  * They model the fraction of low-mass galaxies in the proto-Local Group at z > 6 that survive to z = 0 and the number of mergers or disruptions they undergo.
  * The paper explores how the survival fraction of these galaxies depends on dwarf galaxy mass and distance from the Milky Way.
  * The researchers quantify how resolved stellar photometry by JWST out to farther distances in the Local Group could improve the measurement of the high-redshift UVLF as compared to existing HST observations.
  * Finally, the paper characterises the fidelity of the near-far technique in using Local Group dwarfs to infer the faint end of the high-redshift galaxy UVLF."
"* Problem: How do spiral arms in disk galaxies influence star formation and gas-phase metal abundance from high redshift to present day?

* Solution: 
  * The paper uses spatially resolved IFU data from the MAGPI survey at an intermediate redshift (z~0.3) to provide new constraints on the influence of spiral arms on star formation and gas-phase metal abundance.
  * The study examines the 2D distribution of D4000 and gas-phase metallicity, finding indications of younger stellar age and higher gas-phase metallicity in spiral arms.
  * The research identifies a higher star forming rate (SFR) in spiral arms and a decreasing SFR with increasing distance from the arms.
  * The paper observes asymmetric distributions of interstellar medium (ISM) properties in the downstream and upstream, suggesting a difference in the mixing strength of spiral arms.
  * The study proposes to trace the observed differences in ISM properties by comparing with simulations.
  * The paper plans further analysis of more MAGPI galaxies and a combined study of observations on nearby spiral galaxies at z~0, aiming to provide insights into the long-term effects of spiral arms on the evolution of disk galaxies and contribute to the development of spiral theories."

"* Problem: How does the timing of the onset of galactic winds, caused by supernova explosions, affect the evolution and star formation history of dwarf spheroidal galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to study dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), which are a class of galaxies with the lowest luminosities and are devoid of interstellar gas.
  * The researchers calculate the timing of the onset of galactic winds in these galaxies using observed data. Galactic winds are phenomena in which gas is partially or entirely blown away from a galaxy when a large number of supernova explosions occur in a short period of time.
  * The calculated timing of the galactic winds is then compared with the star formation history of the dwarf galaxies. This comparison helps to understand the impact of galactic winds on star formation.
  * The results of the study show that galactic winds blew away gas in many dwarf galaxies, and that star formation was temporarily or almost completely stopped.
  * The paper also discusses the cases of some dwarf galaxies for which no galactic wind was supposed to have blown, depending on the assumed conditions.
  * Finally, the paper compares the results with several galactic wind models and discusses the relationship with the tidal effects due to the Milky Way's gravitational potential."
"* Problem: How does the specific angular momentum of galaxies relate to their stellar mass, morphology, dark matter halo spin, and the mass of their central supermassive black hole?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers use the TNG100 simulation from the IllustrisTNG project to study the specific angular momenta of about 12,000 central galaxies in a full cosmological context.
  * They examine the relationship between the specific angular momentum and stellar mass for early-type and late-type galaxies, finding that the results align well with observational data.
  * The study investigates the percentage of specific angular momentum retained by these galaxy types from their host haloes, finding a dependence on the methodology used to measure galaxy morphology.
  * The researchers explore the scatter in the specific angular momentum-stellar mass relation with respect to the spin of the dark matter halo and the mass of the supermassive black hole at the galactic centre.
  * They find that galaxies in faster spinning haloes and those hosting less massive black holes tend to have higher specific angular momentum.
  * The study reveals an anticorrelation between halo spin and black hole mass at fixed galaxy or halo mass, suggesting more efficient gas flow towards the galactic centre in slowly rotating systems.
  * Finally, the researchers show that halo spin plays a significant role in determining galaxy sizes, with larger discs forming at the centres of faster rotating haloes, although this trend breaks down for massive galaxies with a stellar mass greater than 10^11 Msun."
"* Problem: How does the evolution of small scale dark matter haloes differ from large scale haloes and how does this impact the understanding of the nature of dark matter?

* Solution:
  * The paper uses the ultra-high resolution cosmological N-body simulation, Phi-4096, to investigate the evolution of satellite dark matter haloes associated with Milky-Way-sized dark matter haloes.
  * It demonstrates that the evolutionary tracks of simulated small scale dark haloes on the V_{max}-r_{max} plane are different from that of the large scale haloes due to tidal effects.
  * The paper proposes a new fitting function for the c-M relation, which is the relationship between the c_{200}, a parameter representing the concentration of the mass distribution of NFW haloes and the virial mass M_{200}, for the mass scale of dwarf galaxies.
  * The authors compare the c-M relation derived from the simulation with the observations on the c_{200}-M_{200} plane, the ρ_s-r_s plane, and the r_{max}-V_{max} plane.
  * The results show that the theoretical prediction nicely reproduces the observed properties of haloes ranging from dwarf galaxies to clusters of galaxies.
  * The paper also compares some empirical scaling laws such as the Burkert relation, the Strigari relation, and the \mu_{0D} relation with the results of the simulation and shows them to be consistent with the theoretical prediction of the \Lambda-CDM model."
"* Problem: What is the origin of the empirical scaling relations in dark matter haloes, particularly in relation to the cusp-core problem?

* Solution: 
  * The paper first presents a comparison between the observed data and the concentration-mass relation (c-M relation), which is a theoretical prediction for the universal properties of dark matter haloes. This comparison is conducted on three different planes: c_{200}-M_{200}, \rho_s-r_s, and r_{max}-V_{max}.
  * The authors then propose a scenario where dark matter haloes are initially formed with central cusps, but some dynamical processes subsequently remove dark matter from the central region.
  * Under this scenario, the authors revert the observed cored profile back to the initial cusp profile. This reversion is conducted under certain conditions about how the transition from cusp to core should occur.
  * The paper does not delve into the detailed physical processes that might be involved in this transition from cusp to core.
  * The reverted scaling relations are found to agree remarkably well with the c-M relation. This suggests that the c-M relation could be the origin of the scaling relations.
  * This agreement also supports the description that cold dark matter produces a cusp in the centre of a halo, and some dynamical process subsequently alters it to a core."
"* Problem: How can the process of heavy element (metal) enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM) of local galaxies be accurately modeled and understood, particularly in relation to the role of metal diffusion and outflows?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of next-generation methodologies to fully utilize the spatial information now available for the study of metal enrichment in the ISM of local galaxies.
  * The authors test a diffusion model on a large sample of spatially-resolved nearby galaxies, which is a first in this field of study.
  * The paper uses parametric fitting of the two-point correlation functions of the nearby galaxies to determine the characteristic ISM diffusion length scales.
  * The wide range of ISM diffusion length scales observed could indicate the role of outflows in redistributing metals, a hypothesis that the paper explores.
  * The authors present a new exploration on how the correlation length of metal fields of galaxies in the Auriga simulation evolve over time.
  * The paper investigates what imprint, if any, these evolving metal fields leave on present day galaxies, providing insights into the importance of metal diffusion over cosmic time."
"* Problem: How can the galactic and extragalactic research be linked to understand the formation and evolution of disk galaxies when the observations are not in the same data format?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a novel approach to generate a mock Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data cube of the Milky Way.
  * This approach makes use of the Single Stellar Population (SSP) spectral libraries and E-Galaxia, a tool for generating synthetic spectra of galaxies.
  * The generated mock IFS data cube can be used to directly compare the Milky Way with external disk galaxies.
  * This comparison can help in identifying signatures of formation processes in the detailed chemo-dynamical structure of disks.
  * The tool can be used to analyze various aspects of the galaxies such as their velocity dispersion profiles, the radial and vertical age gradients.
  * It can also help in determining the mass fraction of the [α/Fe]-rich versus [α/Fe]-poor populations in the galaxies."
"* Problem: How can stellar labels for stars observed in MUSE fields be accurately determined using data-driven machine learning methods?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers propose using the data-driven Payne (DD-Payne) model, which has been successfully used on LAMOST observations, and applying it to stars observed in MUSE fields.
  * They leverage the comparable spectral properties of the LAMOST and MUSE instruments to facilitate the application of the DD-Payne model.
  * The researchers conduct a cross-validation of 27 LAMOST-MUSE common stars to test the accuracy of the DD-Payne model in determining stellar labels.
  * They report that the model can determine stellar labels with precision better than 75K in Teff, 0.15 dex in log g, and 0.1 dex in abundances of various elements for current MUSE observations.
  * The researchers suggest that their method will enable the automated determination of stellar parameters for all stars in MUSE fields.
  * They also propose that their method could be applied to data collected by other spectrographs having resolution similar to LAMOST, and with the upcoming BlueMUSE and MAVIS, they will gain access to a whole new range of chemical abundances with higher precision."
"* Problem: How can the past merger history of external galaxies be understood by examining their central regions, given that spectroscopic observations necessary for extracting stellar population information are mainly confined to these areas?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of the cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the stellar mass build-up in the central 500pc of galaxies, which is influenced by each galaxy's individual interaction history.
  * It is suggested that the nuclear regions of satellite galaxies, which are tightly bound, can survive tidal forces during mergers and efficiently deposit ex-situ material in the center of their host, especially in the case of major mergers.
  * The paper notes that the exact amount of accreted material in the center can vary significantly at fixed galaxy type, ranging from a few to nearly 50 percent for Milky Way like galaxies.
  * TNG50 predicts that ex-situ stars are distinct from in-situ stars, as they are the oldest, most metal-poor and alpha-enhanced population.
  * The author measures similar stellar population signatures in galaxies observed with SDSS by extracting age-metallicity distributions from their integrated spectra covering the same central 500pc.
  * The paper compares the results from SDSS to realistic mock observations from TNG50, highlighting current challenges in measuring and predicting stellar population properties.
  * The synergy between observations and simulations is emphasized as crucial, providing first evidence that galaxy centers can be used to probe past merger events, facilitating comparisons between the individual formation pathways of the Milky Way and its external analogues."
"* Problem: What is the origin of the wave-like breathing motion observed in the Milky Way's stars?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers simulated the flyby interactions of two disk galaxies with a mass ratio of 5:1, altering the orientation of the flyby orbits.
  * They discovered that the flyby interaction triggers a two-armed spiral pattern in the host galaxy, with the strength of this pattern dependent on the angle of inclination during the flyby interaction.
  * The most potent spiral pattern is induced by a prograde-prograde configuration of galaxy flyby.
  * The researchers found that these flyby-induced spiral arms are transient density waves that form just after the pericenter passes and decay slowly after reaching maximum strength.
  * The contracting breathing motion in the disk is associated with the spiral arms, while the expanding breathing motion is linked to the inter-arm region.
  * The researchers confirmed that the breathing motion is not a direct result of the tidal interactions of galaxies, but rather, it is the spiral arms that originate the breathing motion in the disk of the galaxies."

* Solution: 
  * The paper uses the radial velocity method, as applied by the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph, to confirm the existence of five planets orbiting HD 158259 and to suggest the possibility of a sixth, undetected planet.
  * The researchers calculate the semi-major axis, planet's mass, star luminosity, and habitable zones (inner, center, outer, and ∆(HZ)) of the HD 158259 system.
  * The paper accounts for radial velocity amplitude, planet density, and Laplace’s resonance in its theoretical investigation.
  * The potential existence of a sixth planet (HD 158259 g) is investigated, with its orbital period and semi-major axis computed.
  * The paper establishes a direct proportional relation between the mass of the planets and their semi-major axis, with the lowest mass closest to the star and the highest farthest from the star.
  * The habitability zone of the HD 158259 system is compared to that of NASA, Kopparapu et.al, and the original Kopparapu estimate.
  * The relative mean motion ratio (RMMR) is applied for resonance in the triads of successive planets, showing a mode of approximately 2/3 (or 3:2) orbital resonance.
  * The planetary equilibrium temperature (PET) is calculated in terms of the size, temperature, Albedo, and distance of the planet to its parent star."
"* Problem: How can we accurately map the chemical distribution and trace the evolution of chemical abundances over time in the Milky Way and beyond?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST to precisely measure the abundances of at least several hundred thousand stars up to 30 elements, including several elements heavier than iron.
  * The paper suggests combining the spectroscopic data with astrometry from the Gaia mission and asteroseismology with the Kepler mission to cover a wide area of our Galaxy.
  * The paper introduces the use of Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models to probe the mechanisms and conditions of galaxy evolution at different epochs and reproduce the chemical properties of galaxies, particularly the Milky Way.
  * The GCE models implement simple physical laws to generate aggregate chemical trends for a galaxy or a region within a galaxy or multiple regions simultaneously. They have far less computational demands than cosmological chemodynamical simulations and thus can cover a large area in parameter space in a short amount of time.
  * The author demonstrates how their GCE model reproduces the chemical distribution at different locations in the Milky Way and detailed age-abundance relationship in the solar neighbourhood.
  * The paper discusses what can be inferred about the conditions of the Milky Way from the GCE model."
"* Problem: How can we derive detailed star formation histories (SFHs) for the different components of the Milky Way, and use this information to understand the evolution of the stellar mass and metal content in the galaxy?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to derive detailed SFHs for the different components of the Milky Way by directly modelling Gaia colour-magnitude diagrams, a technique that has been successful for external galaxies in the Local Group.
  * The derived SFHs are used to provide an extremely detailed view of the evolution of the stellar mass and metal content in the Milky Way, from the earliest epochs of star formation, with about 10% precision in age even for the earliest epochs.
  * From these SFHs, largely unbiased and homogeneous stellar age and metallicity distributions for the different Galactic components can be obtained, providing an alternative solution to the difficult problem of deriving stellar ages.
  * The paper presents the first spatially-resolved SFHs for the Milky Way disk, derived using Gaia DR3 data. These SFHs show a complex evolution, with many distinct star formation episodes contributing differently at different heights above the plane.
  * The paper also presents the first insights into the SFHs of differentiated Milky Way halo building blocks.

  * The distribution of elemental abundances is predicted and compared to the Galactic Archaeology survey data to validate the simulation.
  * The same chemical enrichment code is used to simulate the formation and evolution of other galaxies across Cosmic Time, including a barred spiral galaxy at z=2.
  * The paper predicts the evolution of mass-metallicity relations and metallicity radial gradients, which can be tested with future observations such as with the James Webb Space Telescope and Atacama Large Millimeter Array."
"* Problem: How does the evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies influence the observed dust properties?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers apply a post-processing dust evolution model to galaxy merger trees from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation.
  * The dust model includes stellar dust production, sputtering in hot gas, dust growth by accretion and coagulation in the dense interstellar medium (ISM), and shattering in the diffuse ISM.
  * The grain size distribution is decomposed into different dust species based on the elemental abundances and the dense ISM fraction provided by the simulation.
  * The study computes dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for Milky Way (MW) analogues, which broadly reproduce the observed MW SED within their dispersion.
  * The study identifies that metallicity and dense gas fraction are the most critical factors for the SED shape, through their influence on coagulation and shattering.
  * The study shows that the most significant increase in the dust SED occurs between redshifts z~3 and 2 in the progenitors of the simulated MW-like galaxies."
"* Problem: How does the Milky Way galaxy assemble its mass over time through the accretion of smaller satellite systems, and what are the observable properties of these disrupted satellite systems?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to use the Latte/FIRE-2 zoom-in cosmological simulations to study the observable properties of disrupted satellite systems in Milky Way-like galaxies.
  * The research focuses on how the stellar mass and time of accretion work together to influence the spatial distribution, orbital energy, and chemical compositions of the stars that belong to the stellar debris of such mergers.
  * The paper presents findings that a significant fraction of the lower-mass satellites accreted at very early times deposit debris in the outer halo of the galaxy, which should be detectable in kinematic surveys probing deeper into the Galactic stellar halo.
  * The research aims to provide a theoretical blueprint that can guide recent and upcoming observational results on the identification of disrupted satellites in the Milky Way.
  * The paper acknowledges that while the findings help constrain the mass assembly history of the Galaxy, the technical details of each accretion episode are not yet fully understood, indicating a need for further research."
"* Problem: How can we better understand the nature and reality of halo substructures in the Milky Way, and what implications does this have for the galaxy's accretion history and mass assembly history?

  * The author plans to examine the distributions of all these substructures in chemical space, considering the abundances of elements sampling various nucleosynthetic pathways.
  * The paper suggests that this approach will help elucidate the nature of the Galactic stellar populations associated with these systems, thereby shedding light on their nature.
  * The results from this examination are expected to provide insights into the reality and nature of halo substructures in the Milky Way.
  * The paper concludes that these results will help place constraints on the accretion history and mass assembly history of the Galaxy, thereby addressing the main research question."
"* Problem: How can the formation and evolution of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like galaxies be accurately studied and understood?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used TNG50, the highest resolution realization of the IllustrisTNG project, to study the formation and evolution of approximately 200 Milky Way- and Andromeda-like galaxies.
  * TNG50's high resolution, comparable to current zoom-in simulations, allowed the researchers to follow the evolution of these galaxies up to high redshift (z~6).
  * The study found that the evolution histories of these galaxies are extremely diverse, with z~2 progenitors of Milky Way/Andromeda-like galaxies extending over ~2 (~1) orders of magnitude in stellar mass (halo mass).
  * The researchers observed that the number and type of mergers that these galaxies undergo is very diverse, with some having their last major merger 10 billion years ago, while others underwent major mergers recently (in the last 5 billion years).
  * Some of the galaxies studied still exhibit a geometric thin disk of only ~200-300 kpc, similar to the Milky Way.
  * The study also focused on the flaring of mono-age stellar disk, finding that TNG50 is able to reproduce different types and amounts of disk flaring, bracketing the majority of the existing observational and theoretical results."
"* Problem: How can we identify and characterize the stellar debris of past accretion events in the Milky Way's halo?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of integrals of motion space (IOM) to search for stellar debris from past accretion events. This is based on the understanding that stars from a single merger are deposited onto similar orbits, which can be characterized by their integrals of motion such as energy or angular momenta.
  * The researchers utilize the Gaia DR3 data-set to identify merger debris in the Milky Way halo near the Sun. This data-set provides a comprehensive catalog of stars, their positions, and their velocities.
  * A parameter-free clustering algorithm is employed to find over-densities in IOM space. This algorithm also allows the researchers to assess the statistical significance of these over-densities.
  * The statistically significant over-densities are then characterized using metallicity and chemical abundance information from Gaia DR3, LAMOST LRS DR7, and APOGEE DR17. This helps in understanding the nature and origin of these over-densities.
  * The analysis reveals that the local stellar halo contains 7 main dynamical groups, including in-situ structures, several previously known accreted substructures, and one new substructure.
  * The researchers also identify a large number of smaller clumps that are interesting dynamically with chemistry suggestive of an accreted origin. This provides an updated view of the Milky Way's accretion history."
"* Problem: How does the current disc configuration of MW-like galaxies form in terms of morphological, chemical, and kinematical properties, given the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model's prediction of galaxy formation through assembly of smaller substructures?

* Solution: 
  * The paper presents the state-of-the-art understanding of the formation of MW-like galaxies, particularly focusing on the disc configuration.
  * It discusses recent observational studies that have discovered extremely metal-poor MW stars rotating in a disc-like configuration, which contradicts the expected formation scenario.
  * The paper confirms the existence of the metal-poor tail of the thin disc within the recent Gaia DR3 database, providing further evidence to support the observational studies.
  * It explores the implications of this discovery, particularly how it challenges the current understanding of galaxy formation under the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model.
  * The paper compares these findings with predictions from cosmological simulations, aiming to reconcile the observed phenomena with theoretical models.
  * It proposes further research and analysis to better understand the processes that lead to the current disc configuration in MW-like galaxies."
"* Problem: How can the balance between direct accretion of ex-situ stars and in-situ star formation, and the transition from thick-disk to thin-disk formation in disk-dominated galaxies be accurately determined?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of AURIGA zoom-in cosmological simulations to extract edge-on maps of stellar age, metallicity, and [Mg/Fe] abundances of 26 Milky Way-mass galaxies.
  * The star-formation and chemical-evolution histories of the thin and thick disks of these galaxies are then analyzed.
  * These results are compared to integral-field spectroscopic observations of edge-on disk galaxies and to recent findings in our own Galaxy.
  * The paper suggests tracking stars across time to unveil the relative contributions of internal evolution and external processes to the formation of these galaxies.
  * The evolution of stellar and gas properties is mapped to uncover the transition from thick-disk to thin-disk formation and their evolutionary connection.
  * This approach allows for the tracing of the full buildup of disk galaxies, providing a comprehensive understanding of their formation and evolution."
"* Problem: How can we accurately estimate the relative ages of stars and understand the age-metallicity relationship across different radial regions of the Galactic disc?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers use the Bayesian Machine Learning framework BINGO to obtain precise relative stellar age estimates for 68,865 red giant and red clump stars observed by the APOGEE DR17 spectroscopic survey.
  * They combine the age and metallicity information to dissect the Galactic disc stars into four radial components: the inner disc, the local disc, the outer disc, and the most outer disc.
  * The age-metallicity relationship is examined across all radial regions, with results indicating a transition of the phase from the thick to thin disc starting approximately 10 Gyr ago.
  * A sharp dip in metallicity around 12 Gyr ago is tentatively identified, most clearly observed within the 8 < R < 10 kpc region.
  * To understand the possible origins of this dip, the researchers explore the age-metallicity relationship in two of the Auriga suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations, Au18 and Au23. In these simulations, a dip of 0.1 dex in metallicity in the outer regions is also observed, coinciding with a gas-rich merger or galactic fountain event.
  * The researchers conclude that the metallicity dip is likely the result of a gas dilution event, and that the existence of such a dip is a valuable diagnostic for determining when the last massive merger of the Milky Way took place, contingent upon a proper treatment of the measurement error in the observed age-metallicity relationship of the Milky Way."
"* Problem: How has the structure of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) assembled, particularly in relation to the survival of its disk during a major merger and the formation of its Giant Stellar Stream?

  * The paper proposes to use data from the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) and Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) surveys to study the nature of M31's inner stellar halo and disk.
  * The study involves measurements for over 3500 individual red giant branch stars, representing the first large-scale chemodynamical analysis of M31's inner disk region.
  * The paper presents evidence supporting an inextricable connection between the formation of M31's inner stellar halo and disk.
  * The paper identifies distinct channels driving the formation of the stellar halo along the major versus minor axes.
  * The paper provides evidence for a uniformly thick structure for the disk.
  * The findings are then placed in the context of the Milky Way and disk galaxy formation in general, providing a broader perspective on galaxy evolution."
"* Problem: How can we better understand the structure and history of the Milky Way, particularly in light of new data showing the Galaxy is far from equilibrium?

  * The paper proposes to dissect and analyze 'phase spirals', patterns in vertical position vs. velocity that are signatures of the Galaxy's past interactions.
  * The researchers report the first discovery of two armed 'breathing spirals' in the inner disc of the Galaxy, providing new insights into its structure.
  * They suggest leveraging high resolution galaxy models to better visualize and understand these phase spirals and the information they provide about the Galaxy.
  * The paper also proposes using dynamical theory to interpret the data and gain insights into the Galaxy's history and structure.
  * The researchers argue that by combining these methods, we can transform our understanding of the Milky Way, using the new data from the Gaia mission to its full potential."
"* Problem: The paper seeks to address the unresolved questions about the formation of the thick and thin disk components of galaxies, including their sequence of formation, the cause of the thick disk's thickness, and the number of formation phases for each component.

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to study the disk structure of edge-on galaxies beyond the local Universe, at a time when the present-day thick disk is expected to be already in place and the thin disk is not fully established yet.
  * The author uses the first image of Stephan's Quintet from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for the analysis.
  * The image reveals 39 distant edge-on galaxy candidates, with photometric redshift out to at least 0.5, which are used as the sample for the study.
  * A preliminary analysis of these galaxies is conducted, suggesting diverse vertical structures, with some galaxies even dominated by a thick disk alone.
  * The author discusses the diverse vertical structure of these galaxies and what it implies for the formation of thin and thick disks across redshift.
  * The findings from this study are used to address the questions about the formation of the thick and thin disk components of galaxies."
"* Problem: How can the complex, position-dependent patterns of age and chemical abundances observed in the Milky Way's stars be coherently explained to enhance our understanding of galactic star formation and evolution?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes a multi-phase accretion and star formation scenario to explain the observed patterns of age and chemical abundances in the Milky Way's stars.
  * The proposed scenario highlights the importance of an early quenching process in the transition from thick to thin disk formation.
  * The scenario also emphasizes the significance of a recent accretion and starburst event, possibly triggered by the pericenter passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, in the thin disk formation.
  * The authors use the wide radial coverage of APOGEE data to quantify the radial properties of the recent gas accretion, aiming to better understand the source of this accretion event.
  * The results of these works provide insights into the thick-to-thin disk transition in the early Universe and gas accretion fueling disk formation at a large range of redshift.
  * This proposed scenario and the results derived from it contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution and enrichment of galaxies in the Universe."
"* Problem: Can the existence of an old thin disc population in the Milky Way be reconciled with models that predict the thin disc to have formed only after the thick disc, around 10 billion years ago?

* Solution: 
  * The paper presents recent observational evidence for the existence of an old thin disc population in the Milky Way, contradicting sequential formation models.
  * The author discusses how these observed trends do not support sequential scenarios where the thin disc forms only after the thick disc.
  * The paper proposes an alternative explanation for the observed trends, suggesting that the early Milky Way disc had gas clumps with high star formation rates.
  * This alternative model suggests that these gas clumps could have led to the formation of an old thin disc population, even if the thin disc started forming after the thick disc.
  * The author argues that this model can nicely explain the observed trends and the existence of an old thin disc population in the Milky Way.
  * The paper concludes by suggesting that further research and observations are needed to fully understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way's disc."
"* Problem: How can we accurately model and understand the cosmological build-up of Milky-Way-like galaxies, particularly in relation to past radial mergers and their observable effects today?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes a new approach that combines high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies with a genetic modification method. This allows for detailed studies of galactic structure and the introduction of controlled changes in a galaxy's cosmological history.
  * The genetic modification method is used to manipulate the significance of a radial merger at a specific point in the galaxy's history, while keeping its cosmological environment and final dynamical mass constant.
  * The paper then compares different scenarios related to the radial merger, establishing a causal link between a galaxy's past mergers and its current observable characteristics.
  * The author scans from a very minor to equal-mass radial merger at a specific point in time, demonstrating that all merger scenarios lead to a significant radially-biased population of halo stars, as observed in the Milky Way.
  * The paper also highlights that each merger scenario results in a different cosmological nature and distinctly different disc morphologies and kinematics. This suggests that the observable characteristics of a galaxy today are heavily influenced by the nature and extent of past radial mergers."
"* Problem: How can different stellar populations in our Galaxy be accurately decomposed and understood in terms of their formation and evolution?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes the use of supervised machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to extract stellar components from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS).
  * The researchers selected GUMS data within 4 kpc from the Sun for each assigned population IDs: 1 for thin disk, 2 for thick disk and 3 for halo populations.
  * They calculated the actions JR, Jphi, Jz, zmax and eccentricity for each stellar population.
  * The random forest classification methods were applied to the dynamical properties data combined with chemical properties (Fe/H and alpha/Fe).
  * The random forest method provided an accuracy of 81%, 77% and 93% for detecting thin disk, thick disk and halo population respectively, and the precision rates were 71%, 68% and 93% respectively.
  * The researchers concluded that the actions, eccentricity, Fe/H and alpha/Fe are effective in discriminating the populations and plan to apply this result with Gaia DR3 data to select the thick disk component to determine its substructures."
"* Problem: How can the number density and kinematics of Gaia DR3 stars be determined and used to test the validity of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) hypothesis?

* Solution:
  * The researchers filtered Gaia DR3 stars within a specific cylindrical volume in the Galactic plane to determine their number density and kinematics.
  * Main sequence stars of types A, F, and early G were used as tracers, under the assumption that they have reached dynamical equilibrium.
  * The completeness of Gaia DR3 was incorporated into the calculation of vertical number density.
  * The vertical kinematics of the tracers in the Galactic plane were calculated, yielding results similar to previous research.
  * The collisionless Boltzmann equation was used to predict the number density of tracers, given the Galactic potential and vertical kinematics.
  * The Poisson equation was used to calculate the Galactic potential from a Galactic density, using a multi-component Bahcall density model, halo dark matter, and a thin dark disk.
  * The results were used to test the MOND hypothesis by ignoring the contribution of dark matter. The critical acceleration was calculated from the modified Poisson equation and compared with existing literature to validate the MOND hypothesis."
"* Problem: How can the assembly history of the Milky Way be explored, particularly in terms of remnants of ancient dwarf galaxy accretion events and the 3D dark matter distribution?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers propose to use the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the DESI Milky Way Survey (MWS) to explore the assembly history of the Milky Way.
  * They generate mock catalogues that match the selection criteria of DESI MWS, using six cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic ΛCDM zoom simulations from the AURIGA cosmological simulation suite.
  * They apply the phase-space smoothing method of Lowing et al. (2015) to these simulations to create the mock catalogues.
  * The mock catalogues are then compared with observational data to understand the nature of the features in the galactic stellar halo that MWS will observe and the sensitivity of the survey to galaxy-to-galaxy variance and alternative models of dark matter.
  * The researchers present a comparison between the mock catalogues and early DESI data.
  * Potential applications of this research include calibration of measurements of the dark matter density profile using halo star kinematics and tests of methods for reconstructing the Galactic accretion history from newly discovered stellar substructure."
"* Problem: How can the formation and evolution history of the Galaxy be traced through the study of local halo substructures and their chemodynamical properties?

* Solution:
  * The researchers used a combined data set from Gaia DR3, APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR3 to trace multiple halo substructures within the solar neighbourhood using Red giants.
  * They studied the chemodynamical properties of these substructures and streams, finding that a 2/3 fraction of halo stars have high eccentric orbits (e>0.8).
  * A particular substructure, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, was studied in detail. Its peak metallicity (Fe/H) was found to be about -1.14 dex.
  * The researchers used a Gaussian approach to identify different halo substructures based on action angle, energy, eccentricity, and metallicity.
  * They examined the distributions of the halo substructure on the Mg/Fe – Fe/H panel with Al/Fe, providing further insight into the properties of these substructures.
  * Through these methods, the researchers were able to gain insights into the formation and evolution history of the Galaxy."
"* Problem: What is the mechanism that drives the warped disk in the evolution of the Galactic warp?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers analyzed the phase space of Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars from the Gaia DR3 database and crossmatched them with stars from the Kordopatis catalog to determine their ages.
  * They used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to infer the warp parameters, applying two warped models (linear and power law) to both spatial and kinematics data.
  * The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine which model provided a better approach, with the linear warp model proving superior to the power law model.
  * The researchers identified the starting point of the warp and its shifts in spatial and kinematics distribution, as well as the warp constant.
  * They conducted an eccentricity analysis of the Southern and Northern warp, which showed that the disk’s potential remains axisymmetric.
  * The values of the precessed rate and the amplitude rate in the axisymmetric potential suggest that the warp is a transient feature due to gravitational interaction with a satellite galaxy.
  * The researchers concluded that after the gravitational interaction, the stars experienced a damped vertical oscillation, which is shown in the deviation in vertical position across different age ranges."
"* Problem: How did the collision of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S) system with the Milky Way influence the formation and evolution of the Galactic thick disk?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers identified the Splash population in the APOGEE DR17 database and ARTEMIS simulations. The Splash population refers to the stars that were abruptly heated due to the collision of the GE/S system with the Milky Way.
  * They studied the ages, chemodynamical, and spatial properties of the Splash population. This helped in understanding the characteristics of the stars affected by the collision.
  * They defined the Splash as the retrograde in-situ population in the simulations. This means that the Splash population consists of stars that were originally part of the Milky Way but were affected by the collision and changed their motion.
  * They compared the Splash fraction between simulated galaxies with and without GE/S like mergers. This comparison helped in understanding the impact of such collisions on the formation of galaxies.
  * They found that on average, galaxies with GE/S like mergers had a higher Splash fraction. This suggests that the collision of the GE/S system had a significant impact on the formation of the Milky Way.
  * They compared their results to the properties of the high-alpha disk to test the formation scenario. This comparison helped in validating their findings and understanding the origin and evolution of the Galactic thick disk."
"* Problem: How can we understand the recent formation history of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), particularly its last major merger and the properties of the cannibalized dwarf galaxy involved?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used the kinematics and chemical abundance measurements of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in M31, along with the star-formation history derived from photometry of resolved stellar populations and the kinematics of red giant branch (RGB) stars, to obtain stringent conditions on the recent formation history of M31.
  * They found that M31's last major merger occurred only ~2.5-4 Gyr ago, in contrast to the Milky Way's last major merger ~10 Gyr ago. The infalling satellite fell along the giant stream, a prominent M31 substructure, in multiple pericenter passages that led to the formation of other prominent M31 inner-halo substructures.
  * The satellite disrupted the M31 disc, forming an older, dynamically hotter thicker disc and a younger, dynamically colder thin disc. The radial chemical abundance gradient and chemical enrichment history of the two discs were inferred from PNe and Galactic chemical evolution models.
  * The researchers concluded that the M31 thicker disc formed in an extended star-formation episode but reached its current dynamically heated state following the merger of the satellite. The M31 thin disc formed in a burst from metal-poor gas brought in by the infalling satellite that mixed with the relatively enriched pre-merger M31 gas at certain radii.
  * The satellite was found to be gas-rich with mass about twice that of M33 and would have fallen into M31 ~2.5-4 Gyr ago, consistent with the burst of star-formation seen throughout M31’s disc from resolved stellar populations.
  * The kinematic results are consistent with major merger simulations of M31 having a 1:4 merger ~2-3 Gyr ago, allowing the researchers to uncover the properties of the cannibalized dwarf galaxy in M31 with great detail."
"* Problem: How can we better understand the process of formation of Milky Way-like galaxies by comparing different simulation models?

* Solution: 
  * The paper first compares the structure and diversity of three different simulation models: Bullock & Johnston's simulations, the Aquarius simulations, and the Auriga simulations.
  * It then analyzes how models are formed in each simulation, focusing on the process and factors that contribute to the formation of these models.
  * The paper evaluates the accuracy of each simulation by comparing the resulting models to the known structure of the Milky Way.
  * It identifies which simulation model is closest to the Milky Way structure, providing insights into the most accurate model for simulating the formation of Milky Way-like galaxies.
  * The paper discusses the implications of these findings for our understanding of the hierarchical formation of galaxies.
  * Finally, it suggests potential improvements or modifications to the simulation models based on the comparison results, to enhance their accuracy in future research."
"* Problem: How do satellite galaxies, particularly the Sagittarius dwarf, impact the dynamical structure of the Milky Way?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used data from the Gaia satellite to observe the dynamical structure of the Milky Way, focusing on the impact of satellite galaxies.
  * They utilized high-resolution N-body simulations to investigate the dynamical impact of the satellites on the Galactic disk.
  * The model of the Milky Way used in the study initially had a bar and spiral arms, and both external and internal perturbations were taken into account.
  * Two Sagittarius-like satellite models were used, one heavy and one light, with total masses of 5x10^10 M_sun and 1x10^5 M_sun, respectively.
  * The researchers observed the solar neighborhood and the inner region of the Milky Way, finding phase-space spirals in both areas, but only for the heavy Sagittarius model in the solar neighborhood.
  * The study found that even low-mass satellites can have a significant impact on the dynamical evolution of host galaxies, as evidenced by changes in the bar's pattern speed and strength due to external perturbation by the dwarf."
"* Problem: How can the chemical evolution of the thick and thin disks of the Galaxy be accurately modeled and understood?

* Solution:
  * The paper proposes two different approaches to model the evolution of the thick and thin disks of the Galaxy: a two-infall approach and a parallel approach.
  * The two-infall approach posits that the thick disk forms quickly and before the thin disk through a fast gas accretion episode, while the thin disk forms through a second accretion episode over a longer time scale.
  * The parallel approach suggests that the two disks form simultaneously but at different rates.
  * The paper compares these model results with observed data, specifically the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions in the two Galactic components.
  * The authors conclude that the parallel approach can account for a group of α-enhanced metal-rich stars present in the data, while the two-infall approach cannot explain these stars unless they are the result of stellar migration.
  * The paper then applies the reference models to study the evolution of various chemical elements, from lithium to europium, providing a comprehensive understanding of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy's disks."
"* Problem: How does the early evolution of Milky Way-sized galaxies, particularly the transition from chaotic pre-disc evolution to rapid disc formation, manifest in the kinematics and chemical abundances of in-situ stars?

* Solution: 
  * The researchers used accurate estimates of aluminium abundance from the APOGEE Data Release 17 and Gaia Early Data Release 3 astrometry to select a highly pure sample of stars with specific metallicity born in-situ in the Milky Way.
  * They identified a low-metallicity in-situ component, dubbed Aurora, which is kinematically hot with an approximately isotropic velocity ellipsoid and a modest net rotation. Aurora stars exhibit large scatter in metallicity and in many element abundance ratios.
  * They observed a sharp increase in the median tangential velocity of the in-situ stars with metallicity between [Fe/H] = -1.3 and -0.9, a transition they call the spin-up. This increase is believed to reflect a rapid formation of the Milky Way disc over approximately 1-2 billion years.
  * They noted a transformation in the stellar kinematics as a function of [Fe/H], accompanied by a qualitative change in chemical abundances: the scatter drops sharply once the Galaxy builds up a disc during later epochs corresponding to [Fe/H] > -0.9.
  * They compared their results with galaxy formation models presented in this and other recent studies, concluding that the trends observed in the Milky Way reflect generic processes during the early evolution of progenitors of Milky Way-sized galaxies.
  * They proposed a two-stage evolution process: a period of chaotic pre-disc evolution, when gas is accreted along cold narrow filaments and when stars are born in irregular configurations, followed by rapid disc formation, signalling the formation of a stable hot gaseous halo around the Milky Way progenitor, which changes the mode of gas accretion and allows development of a coherently rotating disc."
"* Problem: How can the substructures within the Milky Way's stellar halo be effectively identified and traced?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of the combination of LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) and Gaia (a space observatory of the European Space Agency) to gather a large sample of distant halo stars with full phase space parameters.
  * The orbits of the stars in the stellar stream of the Galactic halo are characterized by their integrals of motion, which can be used to identify substructures.
  * The long orbital time periods of halo stars and their minimal dissipation make them ideal for studying the formation of the Milky Way.
  * The paper suggests that members of the stellar stream in the Galactic halo, although on similar orbits, may be on quite different orbital phases, providing further data for substructure identification.
  * The identification of substructures is carried out in the integrals of motion (I.o.M) space, which is a mathematical space used to describe the motion of objects.
  * The paper presents the identified Galactic substructures traced by LAMOST and Gaia, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method."
"* Problem: How can we accurately model and understand the gravitational interactions between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Milky Way (MW), and their impact on the disequilibrium phenomena in the stellar and dark matter halo of the Milky Way?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to build a library of high-resolution N-body models of single accretion events between the LMC and the MW. 
  * Each model in the library represents a grid in the MW-LMC parameter space, which includes variables such as the mass of the LMC, the mass of the MW, the initial kinematic state of the MW halo, the density profile of the MW, and the initial distribution of stars in the stellar halo.
  * The models are matched with observational data to constrain the parameters of the two systems.
  * The library can be used to analyze current observational data of halo stars using modern machine learning methods.
  * The library can also provide guidance for future spectroscopic surveys.
  * The overall aim is to better understand the gravitational interactions between the LMC and the MW, and their effects on the stellar and dark matter halo of the Milky Way."
"* Problem: How can the structure and substructures in the outer halo of the Milky Way be effectively detected and understood?

* Solution:
  * The researchers utilized the entire HSC-SSP data, which covers approximately 1400 square degrees, to investigate the outer halo of the Milky Way. This data is characterized by a wide field of view and deep photometry.
  * An isochrone-filter was created for the old, metal-poor stellar systems on the color-magnitude diagram to effectively detect the substructures in the outer halo.
  * This method allowed for the detection of previously discovered substructures, such as the Orphan Stream.
  * The method also led to the discovery of new substructure candidates in the outer halo of the Milky Way.
  * The researchers propose to discuss the origin of these substructures, providing further insight into the formation and evolution of the Milky Way."
"* Problem: How can the evolutionary history of galaxies be studied more effectively, beyond the limitations of classical approaches that focus on the statistical connection between dark matter haloes and galaxies?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes the use of graph neural networks as a new approach to studying the evolutionary history of galaxies, as a graph is a natural descriptor of the systems at hand.
  * The authors introduce the Equivariant Graph Normalizing Flows Model, which connects high-redshift progenitor graphs with local observables.
  * The model treats the progenitors as a graph, which allows for a robust recovery of their distributions, including their masses, merging redshifts, and pairwise distances at redshift z = 2 conditioned on their z = 0 properties.
  * The generative nature of the model enables other downstream tasks, such as inferring probabilistically the property at z=0 given the configuration at z=2.
  * The model also allows for the detection of anomalies and the identification of subtle correlations of progenitor features.
  * The paper demonstrates the power of this model in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of galaxies."
"* Problem: How can the use and development of observation equipment enhance the visibility and understanding of the Lunar Crescent's movements and appearances?

* Solution:

"* Problem: How can the connection between the creation of the Agastya statue in 760 AD, as mentioned in the Dinoyo inscription, and the appearance of comet 1P/Halley in the same year be established?

* Solution: 
  * The paper proposes to review the contents of the Dinoyo inscription, which mentions the creation of the Agastya statue in 760 AD.
  * It suggests conducting literature studies to understand the context and significance of the Agastya statue in the Vedic religion and its correlation with the star Canopus.
  * The paper proposes to analyze the chronology of events, specifically the timing of the creation of the Agastya statue and the appearance of comet 1P/Halley in 760 AD.
  * It suggests examining the geographical aspects, likely focusing on the location of the Kanjuruhan Kingdom and the visibility of the star Canopus and comet 1P/Halley from there.
  * The paper proposes to study the biographical aspects, particularly the role of Ananah from the Kanjuruhan Kingdom in the creation of the Agastya statue.
  * Finally, it suggests analyzing the mythology surrounding Agastya in the Vedic religion, and its potential correlation with the appearance of comets and specific stars."
