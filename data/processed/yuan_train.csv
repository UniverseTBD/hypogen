Problem,Solution
How can the formation of exponential star-forming disk and metal enrichment in the modified accretion disk (MAD) framework be explained and characterized?,"By treating the galactic gas disk as a simple gas-regulator system, the star formation rate can be determined by the gas content, which is regulated by inflow, outflow, and star formation. This model allows for the derivation of the analytic solution of the radial profile of the gas-phase metallicity, which characterizes the observed features well. The negative gradient of gas-phase metallicity is explained by the radial inflow of cold gas, enriched by in-situ star formation. Magnetic stresses from magneto-rotational instability are suggested as the source of the viscosity that maintains the exponential star-forming disk."
"How can we derive detailed star formation histories (SFH) for different parts of the Milky Way, including the difficult problem of deriving stellar ages?","By using Gaia colour-magnitude diagrams and techniques that have been successful for external galaxies in the Local Group, we can create detailed SFHs. These provide a detailed view of the evolution of the stellar mass and metal content in the Milky Way, from the earliest times of star formation. This approach also allows us to get largely unbiased and homogeneous stellar age and metallicity distributions for different Galactic components."
"The low mass end of the Milky Way's assembly history, particularly the absorption of ultra faint dwarfs (UFDs), is poorly understood and we lack ways to identify stars that accreted from UFDs.","Using the Caterpillar simulation suite, chemical tagging with r-process elements and clustering in kinematic phase space can help identify stars from these dwarf galaxies. Further work is being done with highly-resolved hydrodynamic simulations of the earliest dwarf galaxies to better understand the low-mass end of the Milky Way assembly history."
How do satellite galaxy planes form around massive galaxies in the fuzzy dark matter model compared to the cold dark matter model?,"The study shows that in the fuzzy dark matter model, satellite galaxies tend to form more flattened and corotating satellite systems due to the dissipation by the gravitational cooling effect of the fuzzy dark matter."
"How can the halo spin and halo concentration of a low surface brightness (LSB), gas rich dwarf barred galaxy be estimated, given that the angular momentum distribution of the dark matter halos is still a subject of debate?","A method is proposed that involves forward modelling disk properties derived from observations, using semi analytical techniques, N-body/SPH and cosmological simulations. The best match with observations is a pseudo-isothermal halo model with specific parameters. The model of halo spin distribution matches with that of similar mass analogues of UGC 5288 galaxies in a specific simulation."
How can the chemical evolution of the Galaxy's thick and thin disks be accurately modeled and understood?,"Two different approaches are proposed: a two-infall approach where the thick disk forms fast and before the thin disk and by means of a fast gas accretion episode, and a parallel approach where the two disks form in parallel but at different rates. The models are compared with observed data and applied to study the evolution of various chemical elements."
"How can the formation of boxy/peanut (B/P) bulges, potentially through the buckling instability of the bar, be quantified and understood in real galaxies?","A diagnostic test is developed and applied to a small sample of galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies. The test quantifies the residual mid-plane asymmetry, a potential indicator of past buckling events. However, no clear evidence of such asymmetry associated with past buckling events was found, suggesting that the formation of B/P bulges through strong buckling may be a rare event. The diagnostic can also be applied to the Milky Way to further explore this formation scenario."
What is the chronology and driving mechanisms of the build-up of late-type galaxies (LTGs)?,"Analysis of the star formation histories (SFHs) of bulges and disks for 135 LTGs from the CALIFA survey and comparison with predictions from evolutionary synthesis models suggest a unified picture for the formation and evolution of LTGs, where pseudo-bulges (PBs) and classical bulges (CBs) are extremes of a continuous sequence. Bulges are formed with their parent disks by gradual inside-out growth, which is controlled by the depth of the galactic potential."
"How do the forces exerted by galactic bars in disk galaxies rearrange stars throughout the disk, and what are the observable effects of this rearrangement?","By analyzing an N-body simulation, we can examine the changes in the radial locations of stars after a bar has formed. This analysis reveals angle-dependent and radius-dependent trends in star movement, which can be used to understand the effects of galactic bars. Future analyses could use data from upcoming surveys performed with massively multiplexed spectrographs to further investigate these trends."
How do the feedback processes of massive stars impact star formation in local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPG)?,"Using 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations, the study considers both radiation and supernova feedback. It finds that photoionization feedback suppresses star formation before supernova feedback begins, especially in low-metallicity cases. The simulation results align well with recent observations of local EMPGs."
How can we map the chemical distribution and trace the evolution of chemical abundances over time in the Milky Way and beyond?,"Use Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models, which require less computational power than cosmological chemodynamical simulations, to investigate the mechanisms and conditions of galaxy evolution and reproduce the chemical properties of galaxies."
"Why are some dwarf galaxies observed to be deficient in dark matter, contrary to the expectation that they should be more dominant in dark matter due to their vulnerability to disturbances?","Examine dwarf galaxies in the SPARC and LITTLE THINGS catalogs using the EAGLE simulation galaxies to identify any that are dark matter deficient and explore possible causes. Three galaxies, IC 1613, DDO 50, and UGC 7125, are identified as outliers, with potential causes including distance uncertainties and gas disturbances."
There is a lack of understanding of how a jet interacts with the gaseous/stellar component of a galaxy and how to effectively discover and study faint-fuzzy relic evidence from survey data.,"A modified citizen science approach was used, creating a research collaboratory of trained citizen scientists. These citizen scientists were trained to discover exotic radio galaxies from their homes, using free internet services. Preliminary discoveries were followed up with the GMRT telescope. This approach led to the discovery of new Speca-like rare spiral-host radio galaxies, new cases of rare jet-galaxy interactions, and never-seen-before relic radio bubbles and filaments in elliptical-elliptical mergers."
How can we understand the formation and evolution of the Galaxy by studying the local halo and its substructures?,"By using data from Gaia DR3, APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR3, the researchers traced multiple halo substructures within the solar neighbourhood using Red giants. They studied the chemodyamical properties of these substructures and streams, finding that a significant fraction of halo stars have high eccentric orbits. They also examined a specific substructure, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, and found its peak metallicity. Using the Gaussian approach, they identified different halo substructures based on action angle, energy, eccentricity, and metallicity. Finally, they examined the distributions of the halo substructure on the Mg/Fe â€“ Fe/H panel with Al/Fe."
"How does the early evolution of Milky Way-sized galaxies occur, particularly in terms of metallicity, kinematics, and chemical abundances?","The early evolution of Milky Way-sized galaxies involves a period of chaotic pre-disc evolution, followed by rapid disc formation. This process is reflected in the trends observed in the Milky Way, including a sharp increase in the median tangential velocity of stars with metallicity (the spin-up), a change in chemical abundances, and the formation of a stable hot gaseous halo around the galaxy progenitor."
How can we accurately estimate the relative ages of stars and understand the age-metallicity relationship across different regions of the Galactic disc?,"By using the Bayesian Machine Learning framework BINGO, we can estimate the relative ages of stars. Combining this with metallicity information allows us to categorize stars into different radial components of the Galactic disc. Studying the age-metallicity relationship across these regions, we can identify significant events in the history of the Milky Way, such as a transition from the thick to thin disc and a sharp dip in metallicity likely caused by a gas dilution event."

The diverse vertical structure of these galaxies may provide insights into the formation of thin/thick disks."
"What is the frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars among very metal-poor stars, and how do their properties vary in different Galactic environments?","The paper proposes studying CEMP stars as a population, using spectroscopic surveys to uncover large numbers of these stars. It also suggests comparing various low-resolution spectroscopic samples of very metal-poor stars in the giant regime to understand the properties of CEMP stars throughout the Milky Way."

"How do the filamentary structures in the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions orient with respect to the Galactic plane, and what factors influence their orientations?","The study used observations from the HI4PI, THOR, and MWISP surveys to analyze the filamentary structures in the HI and CO emissions. It was found that the HI filamentary structures in the Milky Wayâ€™s disk regions beyond ten kpc and up to roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic center are predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane, while those at lower Galactocentric radii are mostly perpendicular or do not have preferred orientation. The orientations of the CO filamentary structures differed from those of the HI. These orientations are believed to be influenced by factors such as supernova feedback, Galactic rotation and shear, and local physical conditions like stellar feedback and magnetic fields."
"What is the origin of the empirical scaling relations in dark matter haloes, and how does it relate to the cusp-core problem?","Assuming that dark matter haloes are formed primarily with central cusps and then some dynamical processes remove dark matter from the central region, the cored profile is reverted to the cusp profile. The reverted scaling relations agree with the concentration-mass relation, suggesting that the concentration-mass relation is the origin of the scaling relations."
"How can we gain a deeper understanding of the chemical enrichment, assembly, and star formation histories of disc galaxies, particularly early-type galaxies at high redshifts?","By measuring spatially-resolved stellar population parameters in the LEGA-C ETGs using full-spectrum stellar population synthesis models over different apertures, and extending this analysis to higher redshifts and including star-forming and quiescent galaxies in the future."

The discovery of two armed â€˜breathing spiralsâ€™ in the inner disc also contributes to this understanding."
What is the mechanism that drives the warped disk in the Galactic warp and how does it evolve over time?,"The researchers analyzed the phase space of RGB stars and used MCMC fitting of two warped models to infer the warp parameters. They found that the warp is a transient feature due to the gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxy, and after the interaction, the stellar experienced a damped vertical oscillation."
"The process of growing galactic discs, particularly those with counter-rotating stellar discs, is not fully understood. There is a need to understand the amount, timing, and method of material falling onto the original galaxy.","Using data from the SDSS MaNGA DR17 survey, 56 counter-rotating galaxies were identified. A follow-up observational campaign was initiated at the 6-m BTA telescope to determine the stellar population properties of both stellar discs. Preliminary results suggest a dichotomy in the sample of counter-rotating galaxies, with different luminosity contributions and evolutionary paths for massive and less massive galaxies."
"Understanding the mechanisms of dust origin, evolution, and its effects in galaxies, and how it could be transported out of galaxies by winds is challenging due to the high likelihood of dust destruction in hot gas.","Cholla, a hydrodynamics code, is used for high resolution simulations of single galaxies and can shed light on these mechanisms. The development and implementation of a self-consistent dust model in Cholla will provide new insight into the viability of dust transport by winds and the conditions under which dust can survive in outflows."
Current methods for measuring the star-formation rate in galaxies are inaccurate and biased towards highly star-forming/dusty galaxies.,"A new star-formation rate calibration is proposed using a combination of the WISE Band-1 and Band-3, and the JWST NIR-200W and MIRI-2100W. This method, which includes a stellar mass tracer and the extinction as parameters, provides more reliable estimations, especially for low-star-formation rate and low dust-content galaxies. The calibrations are provided through Monte Carlo Markov chain and machine learning fitting techniques."
"We do not fully understand the formation and destruction of globular clusters, and their contribution to the stellar mass of galaxies.","The study uses data from the 17th data release of the APOGEE 2 survey to evaluate the incidence of second generation globular cluster stars in the Milky Way and its Local Group dwarf companions.

"The star formation histories of dwarf galaxies are not well understood due to limited data on the chemical compositions of their stars, and the relationship between the metallicity of the ""alpha-knee"" and galaxy mass is unclear.","Using the EAGLE simulations, a strong relationship between total stellar mass and knee metallicity was found. The formation of an ""alpha-knee"" is not just due to the onset of Type Ia supernovae, but also a strong decline in the star formation rate. The simulations also predict a large variation in the relationship between total stellar mass and knee metallicity, which is related to the duration of the peak of the star formation history."
"Is the alpha-bimodality, a key property of Galactic disk populations, a common feature of disk galaxies or is it linked with an intense star formation episode making the Milky Way an unusual galaxy?","The researchers will use a combination of NIRCAM photometry and NIRSPEC spectroscopy to study the chemical composition of the old M31 disk, particularly the abundances of Fe, C, N, and O. This will help to understand the history of star formation and mass assembly of the M31 disk and test the hypothesis about the alpha-bimodality and the uniqueness of the Milky Way."
"How can we accurately measure the faint end of the galaxy Ultraviolet Luminosity Function (UVLF) at high redshifts (z > 6) during the Epoch of Reionisation, given that deep-field HST and JWST lensing surveys may not be able to directly observe the faintest galaxies?","An alternative ""near-far"" approach is proposed, which uses the star formation histories of Local Group dwarf galaxies to measure the faint end of the high-redshift UVLF. The study uses the FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations to test uncertainties in this method, models the survival and merger rates of low-mass galaxies, explores how survival depends on dwarf galaxy mass and distance from the Milky Way, and quantifies how resolved stellar photometry by JWST could improve our measurement of the high-redshift UVLF."
"How does the gas supply process from a large scale to a small scale in a barred galaxy occur, and what is its possible role in the growth of a supermassive black hole in a galactic center?","By using high resolution simulations of gas in a barred galaxy potential with the ""ASURA"" code, including a wide temperature range of radiative cooling, star formation in dense and cold gas, and gas heating by supernovae, it was found that a gas ring forms within the central 1 kpc region. Gas clouds form in the ring due to high gas density. Some clouds deviate from the ring due to interactions with other clouds, causing some clouds to fall into the galactic center. This process contributes to the episodic gas supply to the galactic center."
"How can the orientation of the minor axis of the Milky Way's Dark Matter halo be determined, considering that it may be significantly tilted with respect to its central stellar disk?","A new method is proposed that uses the slopes of the line in angle and frequency space from a simulated tidal stream in a realistic environment.

The habitability zone of the system was compared to established estimates, and the planetary equilibrium temperature was calculated."
How does the potential contamination from low/intermediate redshift galaxies impact the selection of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) in large-area surveys conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope?,"By studying the spatial correlation between intermediate and high redshift galaxies and linking it to the leakage fraction, and comparing the observed correlations to outcomes from Monte Carlo simulations of leakage, we can assess the impact of this contamination. Our findings suggest that while ultradeep observations in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field appear to have negligible contamination, larger area surveys might have underestimated the purity of photometric samples."

"How does the anisotropic distribution of Dark Matter (DM) in merging galaxies affect the movement and survival of their sub-components, including former satellites and newly born Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs)?","The study proposes analyzing the radial DM density distribution of two merging galaxies after the merger event and comparing the snapshots with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile of a relaxed halo. The findings suggest that the anisotropic DM distribution affects the gravitational binding of satellites and the tidal force of the merger remnant, which has implications for numerical simulations of satellites and TDGs."

The study also uses NIRISS data to reveal star formation typically hidden at optical wavelengths and quantify the presence of dust.
What causes the lack of interstellar gas in dwarf spheroidal galaxies and how does it affect their evolution?,"The study proposes that galactic winds, caused by numerous supernova explosions, blow away the interstellar gas. This is supported by calculations of the timing of the onset of the galactic wind using observed data and comparisons with the star formation history. However, the study also notes that some dwarf galaxies may not experience galactic winds, depending on certain conditions.

"How can the unique chemical and kinematic properties of the stellar system M 22 and the in-situ component of our Galaxy, Aurora, provide insights into the formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way?","The enhancement of s-process elements in M 22 and Aurora, likely due to pollution from low-mass AGB stars, suggests a link between these systems and the original stars of the Milky Way. This implies that M 22 may have formed concurrently with Aurora, providing valuable insights into the chemical evolution of our Galaxy before the establishment of the disk."
"How can we gain a comprehensive understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, particularly during the epoch of reionization?","By implementing the JWST COSMOS-Web survey, which will map large areas of the universe using NIRCam and MIRI, we expect to detect thousands of galaxies at redshift greater than 6 and more than half a million considering all redshifts.

The study found that star formation activities are concentrated inside the extended gas reservoir, possibly leading to the formation of a bulge structure. The rotation velocity of the cluster galaxies indicates that the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is smaller than the Galactic value."
How can we understand the formation of the first massive galaxies in the early Universe and develop theoretical models for comparison with observational data?,"Perform cosmological radiative-hydrodynamics simulations using the FOREVER22 project.

"The observed kinematic properties of satellite galaxies in the Local Group (LG) are unusual compared to cosmological simulations, a disagreement known as the planes of satellites problem. This disagreement persists even in different dark matter models and is not sensitive to the inclusion of baryonic processes in the simulations.","The observed co-rotation patterns are associated with the out-of-equilibrium state of the galaxy. The properties of the mergers, mass ratios, pericenter passages, and eccentricities, would be needed to reproduce the observational co-rotations pattern observed in the Milky Way and M31. The dynamic state of the LG should be taken into account when comparing it with LG analogs in cosmological simulations."
What is the recent formation history of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and what are the properties of the cannibalized dwarf galaxy in M31?,"The recent formation history of M31 and the properties of the cannibalized dwarf galaxy in M31 can be uncovered through the kinematics and chemical abundance measurements of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in M31, in conjunction with the star-formation history derived from photometry of resolved stellar populations and the kinematics of red giant branch (RGB) stars. The infalling satellite disrupted the M31 disc, forming an older dynamically hotter thicker disc and younger dynamically colder thin disc. The radial chemical abundance gradient and chemical enrichment history of the two discs imply that the M31 thicker disc formed in an extended star-formation episode, while the M31 thin disc formed in a burst from metal-poor gas brought in by the infalling satellite that mixed with the relatively enriched pre-merger M31 gas at certain radii."
What causes the wave-like breathing motion in the motion of stars in the Milky Way?,"The wave-like breathing motion in the motion of stars in the Milky Way is caused by the spiral arms that form during the interaction of two disk galaxies. The strength of this spiral pattern depends on the angle of inclination during the interaction. The strongest spiral pattern is induced by a prograde-prograde configuration of galaxy interaction. The spiral arms are transient density waves that form just after the pericenter passes and decay slowly after reaching maximum strength. The contracting motion in the disk is associated with the spiral arms, while the expanding motion is associated with the inter-arm region."

It found a direct relationship between observation equipment and the potential appearance of the Lunar Crescent.
"There is a conflict between observed planes of dwarf satellites around local galaxies and numerical simulations of similar galaxies, which challenges our accepted cosmology, the Lambda CDM paradigm.","The conflict can be resolved by simulating a larger volume while maintaining small-scale resolution to better capture inflow along cosmic filaments. Using the New Horizon simulation, it is found that about 30% of Milky Way-type systems have satellite planes."
"How can the standard cosmological model account for the existence of low-mass galaxies that lack dark matter, a phenomenon that contradicts the model's predictions and has led to the exploration of alternative theories?",The standard cosmological model can indeed account for galaxies lacking dark matter. This can be achieved through the use of advanced cosmological simulations like FIREbox and careful galaxy-identification techniques. The model suggests that extreme close encounters with massive neighbouring galaxies can lead to the observed lack of dark matter in certain low-mass galaxies.
"How does energetic feedback from star formation influence the formation and evolution of disk galaxies at high redshifts, and how can this be effectively studied?","Use spatially resolved spectroscopy combined with the diffraction limit of large telescopes and strong gravitational lensing to study lensed star forming galaxies.

The data from this program will be made publicly available."
"What can the oldest stars in our Galaxy, particularly the metal-poor and carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, tell us about the Early Universe and the formation of the Milky Way?","By studying the chemo-dynamical properties, Galactic distribution, and orbital properties of these stars, we can gain insights into the early Milky Way and its formation, as well as the early Universe."
"How can we understand the past merger history of external galaxies and their stellar population properties, given that spectroscopic observations are mainly confined to their central regions?","Using the cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, the stellar mass build-up in the central regions of galaxies can be studied. This simulation shows that the nuclear regions of satellite galaxies survive during mergers and deposit ex-situ material in the center of their host. The simulation also predicts that ex-situ stars are distinct from in-situ stars. By comparing the results from SDSS to realistic mock observations from TNG50, we can identify challenges in measuring and predicting stellar population properties. This approach provides evidence that galaxy centers can be used to probe past merger events."
"Understanding the early phases of galaxy formation, including the evolution of stellar populations, the chemical enrichment of galaxies, their ISM properties, and their co-evolution with AGNs, has been challenging due to the inability to observe stellar and nebular diagnostics from the ground.","The NIRSpec GTO programme, with its sensitivity and spectral range, allows for the observation of these diagnostics, enabling an unprecedented characterisation of the physical properties of the early phases of galaxy formation. The programme also provides insights into the detectability of PopIII stars in primeval galaxies."
How do galaxies with less dark matter than predicted by the standard Cold Dark Matter theory form?,Galaxies with less dark matter form through the collision of gas-rich dark matter subhalos. The amount of dark matter in the resulting galaxy depends on the speed of the collision and the mass of the dark matter subhalos.
What are the initial conditions that lead to the formation of Globular Clusters (GCs) and how can we model their formation in different cosmogonies?,The authors apply parameterized models of primordial GC formation to Extended Press-Schechter merger trees and constrain the allowed parameter space through statistical comparison to the observed relation between cluster number and halo mass. They also introduce a new version of the halo mass relation and explore several models in CDM and WDM cosmogonies.
"How can the distinct, orthogonal rotation signatures of globular clusters in M31 be explained, and what do they suggest about the history of accretion events?","Through kinematic analysis, it is proposed that the distinct rotation signatures suggest two separate accretion events, one ancient and one modern. This is further supported by a new analysis of the inner globular clusters of Andromeda, which finds the outer halo kinematics imprinted on this inner sample."
"How do environmental effects influence star-forming activities in low-mass galaxies in high-density regions, and how does this compare to more massive galaxies and those in the field?","By making deep narrow-band observations of two proto-clusters and the general field in COSMOS at z~2, it was found that star-forming activities in low-mass galaxies in high-density regions are enhanced, likely due to increased interactions between galaxies. These interactions can drive gas towards the galaxy center, leading to a central starburst. Unique objects, likely very young galaxies in formation with intense star formation but extremely low stellar mass, were also discovered."
"The baryonic counterpart of the relation between stellar mass and stellar specific angular momentum in disc galaxies is not well studied, even at z=0.","The study presents results on the baryonic specific angular momentum of nearby disc galaxies, finding a power law relation between the baryonic mass and the baryonic specific angular momentum. A new scaling relation between the gas content of galaxies and their mass and angular momentum was also found, which can be used to test the outcomes of models and simulations."
"How do massive and very massive stars, particularly those with low metallicity, contribute to cosmic evolution and what is their potential role as progenitors of Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe)?","By determining the final masses of these stars and studying their nucleosynthesis, we can understand their impact on the Universeâ€™s enrichment and their potential as PISNe progenitors. PISNe, due to their high explosion energies, can be observed to high redshifts, providing a probe of the Universe prior to reionization."

This, along with the view of active star formation from dust continuum from ALMA and the distribution of existing stars provided by Hubble, allows us to construct a picture of how stellar mass is built up over time in massive disk galaxies. Additionally, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can reveal regions of galaxies that are heavily reddened and attenuated by dust, providing further insights into DSFGs."
How can we directly compare the Milky Way with other disk galaxies when the data from the Milky Way and other galaxies are not in the same format?,A new method has been developed to create a mock IFS data cube of the Milky Way using the SSP spectral libraries and E-Galaxia.

It discusses these observational results within the framework of theoretical models for the formation of the local stellar age-velocity dispersion relation, the size-scale height relation, and history of metallicity gradients in local group galaxies."
"The chemical properties of stars in the tidal tails of globular clusters are not well-studied, and it is unclear how these properties contribute to the structure formation of the Milky Way.",The study uses Gaia and APOGEE data to search for and investigate the tidal tail around globular cluster M92. The study applies a matched filter algorithm and the t-SNE algorithm to identify and analyze the chemical properties of cluster member stars. The findings suggest that some stars in the Galactic halo may have originated from the tidal disruption of globular clusters.
"How can we determine the number density and kinematics of Gaia DR3 stars in a specific volume, and use this information to test the MOND hypothesis?","We used certain types of stars as tracers and incorporated the completeness of Gaia DR3 into the number density calculation. We calculated the vertical kinematics of the tracers and used the Boltzmann and Poisson equations to predict the number density of tracers and calculate the Galactic potential. We used a multi-component density model, dark matter, and a thin dark disk to calculate the Galactic density. These results were used to calculate the critical acceleration from the MOND framework, which was then compared with existing literature to validate the MOND hypothesis."

These catalogues can be compared to observational data to understand the features in the galactic stellar halo and the sensitivity of the survey to galaxy-to-galaxy variance and alternative models of dark matter.
"How can the formation of low surface brightness dwarf galaxies, which pose challenges to galaxy formation theory and potentially provide new constraints on the nature of dark matter, be explained?","A new formation mechanism, called the ""ghost galaxy"" scenario, is proposed. In this scenario, inefficient radiative cooling prevents star formation in the dominant dark matter potential of low mass halos, and most of their stellar mass is acquired through mergers. This is supported by merger trees and the CoCo cosmological N-body simulation, which show that mass assembly histories of this kind do occur for low-mass halos in lambda CDM."
How do spiral arms influence star formation and gas-phase metal abundance enhancement in disk galaxies from high redshift to present day?,"Using spatially resolved IFU data from the MAGPI survey, the study found that spiral arms indicate younger stellar age and higher gas-phase metallicity. The star forming rate is higher in spiral arms and decreases with further distance to the arms. Asymmetric distributions of ISM properties were observed in the downstream and upstream, possibly due to the difference in the mixing strength of spiral arms. Further analysis of more MAGPI galaxies and a combined study of observations on nearby spiral galaxies will provide more insights into the long-term effects of spiral arms on the evolution of disk galaxies."

We can also use predictions from isolated galaxy simulations to explain the differences between the bars in different simulations. Improved stellar feedback and AGN in the FIRE3 simulations may result in bars more similar to those observed."

"Understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies under the Î›CDM model is a key unresolved question in astronomy. Traditional models often oversimplify the study by focusing on the statistical connection between dark matter haloes and galaxies, and summarizing the formation environment with crude statistics.","The Equivariant Graph Normalizing Flows Model, a graph neural network, offers a new approach. It treats progenitor systems as graphs, with individual progenitors as nodes. This model can robustly recover the distributions of the progenitors, including their masses, merging redshifts and pairwise distances at redshift z = 2 conditioned on their z = 0 properties.
