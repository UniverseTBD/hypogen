The search for extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way has traditionally been limited by existing methods and the inability to get reliable distances.,"By mimicking a Pristine narrow-band filter in Gaia DR3 data and using a pure sample of Gaia DR3 halo main sequence stars combined with metallicity from deeper Pristine photometry, we can efficiently and uniformly expand the number of spectroscopically studied metal-poor stars and get reliable distances far beyond what would be possible using Gaia parallax.",Observational diagnostics of the old Milky Way using the most metal-poor stars
The Galactic bulge region has typically been avoided in the search for metal-poor stars due to the high density of mostly metal-rich stars and high dust extinction.,"Despite these challenges, the bulge region can provide unique insights into the ancient Milky Way, and through the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS), metal-poor stars in the bulge can be identified and studied, contributing to our understanding of the formation of the ancient inner Galaxy.",Dynamical properties of ancient stars in the inner Milky Way with PIGS 
The conventional belief is that the properties of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars are uniform across different Galactic environments.,"The innovative approach suggests that the properties of CEMP stars may vary between different Galactic environments, indicating differences in early formation and chemical evolution.",On the frequency of carbon-enhanced very metal-poor stars
