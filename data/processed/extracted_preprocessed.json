The denoised age-metallicity relationship of the Galactic disc stars was examined to identify chemical evolution patterns.\n                  Evaluation: The identified chemical evolution patterns were compared with the patterns observed in the Milky Way-like zoom-in cosmological simulation Auriga.\n                  Results: A drop in metallicity with an increase in [Mg/Fe] was observed at an early epoch, followed by a chemical enrichment episode. The patterns suggest that the last massive merger of our Galaxy, the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, was likely a significant gas-rich merger that induced a starburst and contributed to the chemical enrichment and building of the metal-rich part of the thick disc."}, {"text": "### Instruction: Generate a hypothesis about the following problem: Predicting the intrinsic quasar continua is challenging due to our limited knowledge.

Existing recovery methods depend on a small number of high-quality quasar spectra, which may not represent the entire quasar population.\n                  Solution: An unsupervised probabilistic model, Quasar Factor Analysis (QFA), which combines factor analysis with physical priors of the intergalactic medium.\n                  Methodology: QFA models the posterior distribution of quasar continua by generatively modeling quasar spectra.

It produced more accurate results for about 30% of the spectra where previous methods struggled.
