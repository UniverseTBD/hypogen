Problem,Solution
"How do globular clusters (GCs) form, evolve, and disrupt in relation to their host galaxies, particularly during major merger events?",A series of semi-analytical models were designed based on a merger-driven scenario. These models successfully explain the demographics of GCs and various relationships between GC populations and their host galaxies.
How can we better understand the structure and substructures in the outer halo of the Milky Way?,"By using the entire HSC-SSP data and creating an isochrone-filter for the old, metal-poor stellar systems on the color-magnitude diagram, we can effectively detect the substructures in the outer halo. This method has allowed us to detect previously discovered substructures and discover new candidates."
"How does the evolution of grain size distribution in galaxies affect observed dust properties, and how can this be accurately modeled?","A post-processing dust evolution model is applied to galaxy merger trees from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. The model includes stellar dust production, sputtering in hot gas, dust growth by accretion and coagulation in the dense interstellar medium (ISM), and shattering in the diffuse ISM. The model's success in reproducing the Milky Way's spectral energy distributions (SEDs) justifies the dust evolution processes included in the model."
"How can we understand the spatial distribution, kinematics, and properties of the cold ionized gas in the early universe galaxy COS-2987030247?","By using high-resolution observations of the [C II] 158um line emission obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we can compare the spatial distribution and extension of the [C II] and rest-frame UV emission, model the [C II] line data-cube, and analyze the velocity map. This allows us to infer the system's composition and potential rotating nature, supporting the need for kpc-scale resolved observations."
How can we analyze and interpret the star formation histories and stellar populations in different regions of local grand design spiral galaxies?,"By using a detailed photometric analysis of data ranging from UV to far-Infrared, a spatially resolved study down to ~0.5Kpc scales, an SED fitting procedure, and a Bayesian approach (BAGPIPES), we can reconstruct the star formation histories and detect old stellar populations in these galaxies. Possible interpretations of these findings can be discussed, considering both in-situ and ex-situ scenarios."
"How can we observe and understand the impact of galaxy scale winds on the early growth of disk galaxies, especially considering the difficulty of observing outflows at redshifts corresponding to early disk growth?","The speaker proposes using detailed imaging of outflows in local star bursting, low metallicity disk galaxies as analogues of the early universe. They have created detailed maps of these outflows and developed a new method for characterising star-formation driven outflows in edge on galaxies. They also present work making direct estimates of the metallicity of the outflow using the auroral emission lines. These observations and methods can inform models of early galaxy growth and aid in the interpretation of results from JWST."
What is the impact of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S) system collision on the Milky Wayâ€™s formation history and what are the properties of the resulting Splash population?,"The Splash population was identified and studied in the APOGEE DR17 database and ARTEMIS simulations. The simulations showed that galaxies with GE/S like mergers have a higher Splash fraction on average. By comparing these results to the properties of the high-alpha disk, the formation scenario was tested, providing new insights into the origin and evolution of the Galactic thick disk."
Traditional stellar population models cannot accurately predict the observed blueness of the Universe and the extremely low metal content of z>6 emission line galaxies.,"The speaker proposes using JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec observations, along with results from the JWST GLASS ERS survey, to study these phenomena. They also suggest mapping the metallicity and element abundances of the two lowest metallicity galaxies in the local Universe and considering non-traditional supernovae enrichment mechanisms to explain the observed abundances."
"Understanding the evolution of disk galaxies is complex due to the multitude of internal and external processes acting on them, and a comprehensive framework based on a single object like the Milky Way is insufficient.","The GECKOS survey aims to reveal the variation in key physical processes of disk formation by studying a sample of 35 nearby, edge-on disk galaxies. This is done by connecting Galactic Archaeology with JWST studies of turbulent star-forming disks in the early Universe, and using the data to extend Galactic methods to the wider galaxy population."
Identifying the cosmological build-up of our Galaxy is challenging due to the need for models that match the high level of detail in galactic datasets and can distinguish between different formation scenarios.,A new approach is proposed that combines high-resolution simulations of galaxies and a genetic modification approach. This allows for controlled changes in a galaxy's cosmological history and enables a link between a galaxy's past mergers and its current observables.
"How can the bar pattern speed of stellar bars be accurately measured, and does this measurement align with the predictions of the LCDM model?",The Tremaine-Weinberg method can be used to directly measure the bar pattern speed. This method was tested and confirmed using high resolution N-body simulations on deep spectroscopy of the NIRSpec IFU mounted to the JWST for a sample of bars at z~1-2.
"How do the most massive disk galaxies in the local Universe behave in terms of their halo masses, rotation curves, and their relation to dark matter?","By using new HI observations of a sample of very massive disks, extended HI rotation curves and mass models were derived, and robust estimates of their halo masses were obtained. It was found that these galaxies follow the Tully-Fisher and Fall relations, inhabit less massive halos than predicted, and retain a significant fraction of the halo specific angular momentum. These findings suggest that massive discs grow efficiently throughout cosmic time, without experiencing disruptive events."
How do bars in galaxies affect the growth of black hole masses?,"By conducting a statistical study on black hole masses in barred and unbarred galaxies using the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological simulation suites, it was found that the median peak value of black hole masses distribution for barred galaxies was higher than that of the unbarred ones. This is supported by the higher mean accretion rate on the black hole over large redshifts in barred galaxies. These results are not affected by other environmental processes like the neighboring gas density of hosts and merger histories."
"How can we explore and understand the spatial distribution of mm-wavelength dust emission from galaxies, particularly in the grand design spiral galaxy NGC6946?","By using the NIKA2 Guaranteed Time Project IMEGIN to map the mm emission, subtracting contributions from free-free, synchrotron, and CO line emission to isolate pure dust emission, and separating arm/interarm regions. The study also uses Bayesian MCMC modeling to present maps of dust mass, temperature, and emissivity index."
"The linear gradient models that describe the metal distribution in local, star-forming galaxies cannot be applied to distant, irregular galaxies at cosmic noon with large, kpc-scale metal rich clumps.",The speaker proposes to use geostatistical modelling and fit a hierarchical model to JWST-GLASS data. This will help understand the chemical substructures of galaxies at both low- and high-redshift and how the spatial extent of metal-rich clumps evolves throughout cosmic time. This approach will also test subgrid models of metal mixing and improve our understanding of galaxy evolution.
