# Critic Chain: Takes a hypothesis and provides a critique.

Given the following hypothesis:
{hypothesis}

Analyse each part of the hypothesis:
1. Clarity: Are the statements clear and easy to understand?
2. Coherence: Do the different parts of the hypothesis logically flow together? Does it seem like the proposed solution would work?
3. Scientific Validity: Are there any scientific inaccuracies or assumptions that seem unfounded?

After your analysis, provide specific feedback on how each field (Problem, Solution, Methodology, Evaluation) can be improved.
Specifically, give feedback on the frailties of the idea as a whole, and suggest potential enhancements.
