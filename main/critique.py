# Critic Chain: Takes a hypothesis and provides a critique.
critic_template = """
Given the following hypothesis:
{hypothesis}

And the following relevant papers:
{context}

Analyse each part of the hypothesis:
1. Clarity: Are the statements clear and specific? What is vague?
2. Coherence: Do the different parts of the hypothesis logically flow together? Does it seem like the proposed solution would work?
3. Scientific Validity: Are there any scientific inaccuracies or assumptions that seem unfounded?

After your analysis, provide specific feedback on how the flip can be improved, either conceptually (changing the idea) or microscopically (changing the implementation).
Do not focus your critique on the proposed evaluation of the idea. Rather, focus on the mechanics of the idea itself. 
Specifically, give feedback on the frailties of the idea as a whole, and suggest potential enhancements.
"""

reviser_template = """
You are tasked with revising an original hypothesis based on a critique. Here are the details:

Original Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Critique: {critique}

Your revised hypothesis (representing an idea) should:
- Be limited to three sentences, but don't number them. Don't make the sentences overly long.
- The potential for the idea is the most important thing. Be creative and yet plausible in the specific idea.
- Represent one holistic idea, not multiple scattered ideas or simply lists of methods. The idea should be integrated and coherent.
- Focus on the implementation and mechanics of the idea, not how it will be evaluated. 
- Address each point in the critique with a specific solution in the hypothesis. Don't just say "will be further explored" or acknowledge problems without providing solutions.
- Be scientifically valid, clear, and coherent.
- Maximize information density and conciseness of the three-sentence hypothesis. Ensure the sentences are not overly long.
- Prioritize scientific specifics and insight over generalities. Do not be trite or vague.
- Be as feasible, accurate, and creative as the critique allows.

Please only write the revised hypothesis.
