(ETGs) with prominent dust lanes. 65% of these `dusty ETGs' (D-ETGs) are
morphologically disturbed, suggesting a merger origin. This is consistent with
the D-ETGs residing in lower density environments compared to the controls
drawn from the general ETG population. 80% of D-ETGs inhabit the field
(compared to 60% of the controls) and <2% inhabit clusters (compared to 10% of
the controls). Compared to the controls, D-ETGs exhibit bluer UV-optical
colours (indicating enhanced star formation) and an AGN fraction that is more
than an order of magnitude greater (indicating higher incidence of nuclear
activity). The clumpy dust mass residing in large-scale features is estimated,
using the SDSS r-band images, to be 10^{4.5}-10^{6.5} MSun. A comparison to the
total (clumpy + diffuse) dust masses- calculated using the far-IR fluxes of 15%
of the D-ETGs that are detected by the IRAS- indicates that only ~20% of the
dust resides in these large-scale features. The dust masses are several times
larger than the maximum value expected from stellar mass loss, ruling out an
internal origin. The dust content shows no correlation with the blue
luminosity, indicating that it is not related to a galactic scale cooling flow.
No correlation is found with the age of the recent starburst, suggesting that
the dust is accreted directly in the merger rather than being produced in situ
by the triggered star formation. Using molecular gas-to-dust ratios of ETGs in
the literature we estimate that the median current and initial molecular gas
fraction are ~1.3% and ~4%, respectively. Recent work suggests that the merger
activity in nearby ETGs largely involves minor mergers (mass ratios between
1:10 and 1:4). If the IRAS-detected D-ETGs form via this channel, then the
original gas fractions of the accreted satellites are 20%-44%. [Abridged]

local early-type galaxies exhibiting dust features. We use optical and radio
data to examine the nature of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in these
objects, and compare these with a carefully constructed control sample. We find
that dust lane early-type galaxies are much more likely to host emission-line
AGN than the control sample galaxies. Moreover, there is a strong correlation
between radio and emission-line AGN activity in dust lane early-types, but not
the control sample. Dust lane early-type galaxies show the same distribution of
AGN properties in rich and poor environments, suggesting a similar triggering
mechanism. By contrast, this is not the case for early-types with no dust
features. These findings strongly suggest that dust lane early-type galaxies
are starburst systems formed in gas-rich mergers. Further evidence in support
of this scenario is provided by enhanced star formation and black hole
accretion rates in these objects. Dust lane early-types therefore represent an
evolutionary stage between starbursting and quiescent galaxies. In these
objects, the AGN has already been triggered but has not as yet completely
destroyed the gas reservoir required for star formation.

find that, especially at low metallicity, the production of r-process elements

support the core-collapse supernovae as the r-process site. We also verify the
over-abundances of light s-process elements at low metallicity, and find that
the relative contribution decreases at higher metallicity, which suggests that
this lighter elements primary process may be associated with massive stars.
[...] Our analysis reveals two types of core-collapse supernovae: one produces
mainly alpha-elements, the other produces both alpha-elements and Fe-peak
elements with a large enhancement of heavy Fe-peak elements which may be the
contribution from hypernovae. [...] The extra contribution from low mass AGB
stars at high metallicity compensates the dimension loss due to the
homogenization of the core-collapse supernovae ejecta. [...] the number of
independent dimensions of the [X/Fe]+[Fe/H] chemical space in the solar

elemental abundances as a probe to reconstruct dispersed clusters. We find
discrepancies between Cr I and Cr II abundances as well as between Ti I and Ti

follows other such studies which demonstrate the effects of overionization in

potential based on the phase-space information for many individual stars. Such
an approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic
surveys of the Galaxy and in the future Gaia. This approach describes the orbit
distribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF)
proposed by McMillan and Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these
parametrized DFs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-space
distributions of individual abundance-selected Galactic subpopulations of stars
(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, which
enables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic
mono-abundance populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to
constrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint
likelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over
the DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection
function inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the
uncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,
we study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be
reached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. By
creating mock samples from the DF, we show that, even under a restrictive and
realistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitational
potential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent with
sample sizes of a few thousands. The assumptions of axisymmetry, of DFs that
are smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitations
in our current study.

interaction between antimatter and ordinary matter was discussed. The author
argued that this anti-gravity can be regarded as a prediction of general
relativity, under the assumption of CPT symmetry. Stringent experimental
constraints have been established against such a suggestion. The measurement of
free-fall accelerations of various nuclei by the Eot-Wash group and searches
for equivalence principle violation through the gravitational splitting in kaon
physics consistently establish null results on any difference between the
gravitational behaviour of antimatter and ordinary matter. The original
arguments against antigravity were questioned by Nieto & Goldman (1991). In the
light of new experiments as well as theoretical developments in the past 20
years, some of Nieto & Goldman's concerns have been addressed. While a precise
measurement of the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen will eventually lay
this issue to rest, the purpose of this short letter is to argue that the
substitution of dark energy with anti-gravity by antimatter, as suggested by
Villata, is highly unlikely.

bulge-dominated galaxies with large dust lanes, which have had a recent minor
merger. We find these galaxies are very gas rich, with H2 masses between 4x10^8
and 2x10^10 Msun. We use these molecular gas masses, combined with atomic gas
masses from an accompanying paper, to calculate gas-to-dust and gas-to-stellar
mass ratios. The gas-to-dust ratios of our sample objects vary widely (between
~50 and 750), suggesting many objects have low gas-phase metallicities, and
thus that the gas has been accreted through a recent merger with a lower mass
companion. We calculate the implied minor companion masses and gas fractions,
finding a median predicted stellar mass ratio of ~40:1. The minor companion
likely had masses between ~10^7 - 10^10 Msun. The implied merger mass ratios
are consistent with the expectation for low redshift gas-rich mergers from
simulations. We then go on to present evidence that (no matter which
star-formation rate indicator is used) our sample objects have very low
star-formation efficiencies (star-formation rate per unit gas mass), lower even
than the early-type galaxies from ATLAS3D which already show a suppression.
This suggests that minor mergers can actually suppress star-formation activity.
We discuss mechanisms that could cause such a suppression, include dynamical
effects induced by the minor merger.

holds key clues not only to their formation but also to the assembly histories
of galaxies. One of the most exciting possibilities is the use of stellar
abundance patterns as ""chemical tags"" to identify stars that were born in the
same molecular cloud. In this paper we assess the prospects of chemical tagging
as a function of several key underlying parameters. We show that in the
fiducial case of $10^4$ distinct cells in chemical space and $10^5-10^6$ stars
in the survey, one can expect to detect $\sim 10^2-10^3$ groups that are $\ge
5\sigma$ overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that even very
large overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity is
due to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. In fact, for our
fiducial model parameters, the typical $5\sigma$ overdensity is comprised of
stars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributing
only 25% of the stars. The most important factors limiting the identification
of disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in
the chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar
population. Both of these factors can be improved through strategic
observational plans. While recovering individual clusters through chemical
tagging may prove challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that
different CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These
differences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the slope and
high mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.

their element abundances. The concept of chemical tagging is to identify
members of disrupted clusters by their clustering in element abundance space.
Chemical tagging requires large samples of stars with precise abundances for
many individual elements. With uncertainties of $\sigma_{[X/{\rm Fe}]}$ and
$\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} \simeq 0.05$ for 10 elements measured for $>10^4$ stars,
the APOGEE DR12 spectra may be the first well-suited data set to put this idea
into practice. We find that even APOGEE data offer only $\sim 500$ independent
volume elements in the 10-dimensional abundance space, when we focus on the
$\alpha$-enhanced Galactic disk. We develop and apply a new algorithm to search
for chemically homogeneous sets of stars against a dominant background. By
injecting star clusters into the APOGEE data set we show that chemically
homogeneous clusters with masses $\gtrsim 3 \times 10^7 \, {\rm M}_\odot$ would
be easily detectable and yet no such signal is seen in the data. By
generalizing this approach, we put a first abundance-based constraint on the

rectilinear grid of synthetic spectra to derive the stars' labels: stellar
parameters and elemental abundances. However, the number of synthetic spectra
needed for a rectilinear grid grows exponentially with the label space
dimensions, precluding the simultaneous and self-consistent fitting of more
than a few elemental abundances. Shortcuts such as fitting subsets of labels
separately can introduce unknown systematics and do not produce correct error
covariances in the derived labels. In this paper we present a new approach --
CHAT (Convex Hull Adaptive Tessellation) -- which includes several new ideas
for inexpensively generating a sufficient stellar synthetic library, using
linear algebra and the concept of an adaptive, data-driven grid. A convex hull
approximates the region where the data lie in the label space. A variety of
tests with mock datasets demonstrate that CHAT can reduce the number of
required synthetic model calculations by three orders of magnitude in an 8D
label space. The reduction will be even larger for higher-dimensional label
spaces. In CHAT the computational effort increases only linearly with the
number of labels that are fit simultaneously. Around each of these grid points
in label space an approximate synthetic spectrum can be generated through
linear expansion using a set of ""gradient spectra"" that represent flux
derivatives at every wavelength point with respect to all labels. These
techniques provide new opportunities to fit the full stellar spectra from large

unfeasible, because the number of ab initio spectral model grid calculations
scales exponentially with $\mathcal{N}$. We suggest instead the construction of
a polynomial spectral model (PSM) of order $\mathcal{O}$ for the model flux at
each wavelength. Building this approximation requires a minimum of only
${\mathcal{N}+\mathcal{O}\choose\mathcal{O}}$ calculations: e.g. a quadratic
spectral model ($\mathcal{O}=2$) to fit $\mathcal{N}=20$ labels simultaneously,
can be constructed from as few as $231$ ab initio spectral model calculations;
in practice, a somewhat larger number ($\sim 300-1000$) of randomly chosen
models lead to a better performing PSM. Such a PSM can be a good approximation
only over a portion of label space, which will vary case by case. Yet, taking
the APOGEE survey as an example, a single quadratic PSM provides a remarkably
good approximation to the exact ab initio spectral models across much of this
survey: for random labels within that survey the PSM approximates the flux to
within $10^{-3}$, and recovers the abundances to within $\sim 0.02$ dex rms of
the exact models. This enormous speed-up enables the simultaneous many-label
fitting of spectra with computationally expensive ab initio models for stellar
spectra, such as non-LTE models. A PSM also enables the simultaneous fitting of
observational parameters, such as the spectrum's continuum or line-spread
function.

survey. The high ($>10^7$ K) brightness temperature required for an mJIVE-20
detection allows us to unambiguously identify the radio AGN in our sample. We
find three such objects. Our VLBI AGN identifications are classified as
Seyferts or LINERs in narrow line optical diagnostic plots; mid-infrared
colours of our targets and the comparison of H$\alpha$ star formation rates
with integrated radio luminosity are also consistent with the VLBI
identifications. We reconstruct star formation histories in our galaxies using
optical and UV photometry, and find that these radio AGN are not triggered
promptly in the merger process, consistent with previous findings for non-VLBI
samples of radio AGN. This delay can significantly limit the efficiency of
feedback by radio AGN triggered in galaxy mergers. We find that radio AGN hosts
have lower star formation rates than non-AGN radio-selected galaxies at the
same starburst age. Conventional and VLBI radio imaging shows these AGN to be
compact on arcsecond scales. Our modeling suggests that the actual sizes of
AGN-inflated radio lobes may be much larger than this, but these are too faint
to be detected in existing observations. Deep radio imaging is required to map
out the true extent of the AGN, and to determine whether the low star formation
rates in radio AGN hosts are a result of the special conditions required for
radio jet triggering, or the effect of AGN feedback.

Cannon, a data-driven approach to spectral modeling, to construct a predictive
model for LAMOST spectra. Our reference set comprises 8125 stars observed in
common between the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys, taking seven APOGEE DR12 labels
(parameters) as ground truth: Teff, logg, [M/H], [$\alpha$/M], [C/M], [N/M],
and Ak. We add seven colors to the Cannon model, based on the g, r, i, J, H, K,
W1, and W2 magnitudes from APASS, 2MASS & WISE, which improves our constraints
on Teff and logg by up to 20% and on Ak by up to 70%. Cross-validation of the
model demonstrates that, for high-SNR objects, our inferred labels agree with
the APOGEE values to within 50 K in temperature, 0.04 magnitudes in Ak, and <
0.1 dex in logg, [M/H], [C/M], [N/M], and [$\alpha$/M]. We apply the model to
450,000 giants in LAMOST DR2 that have not been observed by APOGEE. This
demonstrates that precise individual abundances can be measured from

determination of many elements in many stars. A common perception is that
deriving more than a few elemental abundances ([Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], perhaps
[C/H], [N/H]) requires medium-to-high spectral resolution, $R \gtrsim 10,000$,
mostly to overcome the effects of line blending. In recent work (Rix et al.
2016; Ting et al. 2016) we presented an efficient and practical way to model
the full stellar spectrum, even when fitting a large number of stellar labels
simultaneously. In this paper we quantify to what precision the abundances of
many different elements can be recovered, as a function of spectroscopic
resolution and wavelength range. In the limit of perfect spectral models and
spectral normalization, we show that the precision of elemental abundances is
nearly independent of resolution, for a fixed exposure time and number of
detector pixels; low-resolution spectra simply afford much higher S/N per pixel
and generally larger wavelength range in a single setting. We also show that
estimates of most stellar labels are not strongly correlated with one another
once $R \gtrsim 1,000$. Modest errors in the line spread function, as well as
small radial velocity errors, do not affect these conclusions, and data driven
models indicate that spectral (continuum) normalization can be achieved well
enough in practice. These results, to be confirmed with an analysis of observed
low-resolution data, open up new possibilities for the design of large
spectroscopic stellar surveys and for the re-analysis of archival
low-resolution datasets.

stars across the Milky Way, far more than any current stellar survey at a
corresponding or higher spectral resolution. It is often assumed that only very
few elemental abundances can be measured from such low-resolution spectra,
limiting their utility for Galactic archaeology studies. However, Ting et al.
(2017) used ab initio models to argue that low-resolution spectra should enable
precision measurements of many elemental abundances, at least in theory. Here
we verify this claim in practice by measuring the relative abundances of 14
elements from LAMOST spectra with a precision of $\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for objects
with ${\rm S/N}_{\rm LAMOST}$ > 30 (per pixel). We employ a spectral modeling
method in which a data-driven model is combined with priors that the model
gradient spectra should resemble ab initio spectral models. This approach
assures that the data-driven abundance determinations draw on physically
sensible features in the spectrum in their predictions and do not just exploit
astrophysical correlations among abundances. Our analysis is constrained to the
number of elemental abundances measured in the APOGEE survey, which is the
source of the training labels. Obtaining high quality/resolution spectra for a
subset of LAMOST stars to measure more elemental abundances as training labels
and then applying this method to the full LAMOST catalog will provide a sample
with more than 20 elemental abundances that is an order of magnitude larger
than current high-resolution surveys, substantially increasing the sample size
for Galactic archaeology.

tremendous amount of information about that galaxy's physical properties and
assembly history. However, present methods for extracting information from
chemical distributions are based either on coarse averages measured over
galactic scales (e.g., metallicity gradients) or on searching for clusters in
chemical space that can be identified with individual star clusters or gas
clouds on $\sim 1$ pc scales. These approaches discard most of the information,
because in galaxies gas and young stars are observed to be distributed
fractally, with correlations on all scales, and the same is likely to be true
of metals. In this paper we introduce a first theoretical model, based on
stochastically-forced diffusion, capable of predicting the multi-scale
statistics of metal fields. We derive the variance, correlation function, and
power spectrum of the metal distribution from first principles, and determine
how these quantities depend on elements' astrophysical origin sites and on the
large-scale properties of galaxies. Among other results, we explain for the
first time why the typical abundance scatter observed in the interstellar media
of nearby galaxies is $\approx 0.1$ dex, and we predict that this scatter will
be correlated on spatial scales of $\sim 0.5-1$ kpc, and over time scales of
$\sim 100-300$ Myr. We discuss the implications of our results for future
chemical tagging studies.

atmospheres to `reconstruct' chemically homogeneous star clusters that have
long since dispersed. The GALAH spectroscopic survey --which aims to observe
one million stars using the Anglo-Australian Telescope -- allows us to measure
up to 30 elements or dimensions in the stellar chemical abundance space, many
of which are not independent. How to find clustering reliably in a noisy
high-dimensional space is a difficult problem that remains largely unsolved.
Here we explore t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) -- which
identifies an optimal mapping of a high-dimensional space into fewer dimensions
-- whilst conserving the original clustering information. Typically, the
projection is made to a 2D space to aid recognition of clusters by eye. We show
that this method is a reliable tool for chemical tagging because it can: (i)
resolve clustering in chemical space alone, (ii) recover known open and
globular clusters with high efficiency and low contamination, and (iii) relate
field stars to known clusters. t-SNE also provides a useful visualization of a
high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the method on a dataset of 13 abundances
measured in the spectra of 187,000 stars by the GALAH survey. We recover 7 of
the 9 observed clusters (6 globular and 3 open clusters) in chemical space with
minimal contamination from field stars and low numbers of outliers. With
chemical tagging, we also identify two Pleiades supercluster members (which we
confirm kinematically), one as far as 6$^\circ$ -- one tidal radius away from
the cluster centre.

We perform simple experiments with synthetic spectra to investigate the effect
of unresolved main-sequence binaries on spectral fitting, modeling spectra
similar to those collected by the APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST surveys. We find
that fitting unresolved binaries with single-star models introduces systematic
biases in the derived stellar parameters and abundances that are modest but
certainly not negligible, with typical systematic errors of $300\,\rm K$ in
$T_{\rm eff}$, 0.1 dex in $\log g$, and 0.1 dex in $[\rm Fe/H]$ for APOGEE-like
spectra of solar-type stars. These biases are smaller for spectra at optical
wavelengths than in the near-infrared. We show that biases can be corrected by
fitting spectra with a binary model, which adds only two labels to the fit and
includes single-star models as a special case. Our model provides a promising
new method to constrain the Galactic binary population, including systems with
single-epoch spectra and no detectable velocity offset between the two stars.

an initial sample of $\sim$20,000 main-sequence targets, we identify

$\sim$200 triple systems, as well as $\sim$700 velocity-variable systems in

simplifies the process of simultaneously fitting single- or multi-epoch spectra
with composite models and does not depend on a velocity offset between the two
components of a binary, making it sensitive to traditionally undetectable
systems with periods of hundreds or thousands of years. In agreement with
conventional expectations, almost all the spectrally-identified binaries with
measured parallaxes fall above the main sequence in the color-magnitude

inferred mass ratios for the $\sim$600 binaries in which a dynamical mass ratio

determining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging, because of the
shortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their optical spectra as well as
observational and theoretical complications with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D,
non-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al. (2017) were recently able to demonstrate
that oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R$\simeq$2000)
optical spectra. Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a
measurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest
spectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but
are manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer
atmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the
oxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all other carbon-bearing
molecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C$_2$ features across
the optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in
atomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the
other carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen
abundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both
the CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing
non-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the
results show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be limited
to those elements that have observable lines themselves.

early-type galaxies (ETGs) at low redshift, yet the star formation efficiency
(SFE; the star formation rate divided by the molecular gas mass) appears to be
strongly suppressed following some of these events, in contrast to the more
well-known merger-driven starbursts. We present observations with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of six ETGs, which have each
recently undergone a gas-rich minor merger, as evidenced by their disturbed
stellar morphologies. These galaxies were selected because they exhibit
extremely low SFEs. We use the resolving power of ALMA to study the morphology
and kinematics of the molecular gas. The majority of our galaxies exhibit
spatial and kinematical irregularities, such as detached gas clouds, warps, and
other asymmetries. These asymmetries support the interpretation that the
suppression of the SFE is caused by dynamical effects stabilizing the gas
against gravitational collapse. Through kinematic modelling we derive high
velocity dispersions and Toomre Q stability parameters for the gas, but caution
that such measurements in edge-on galaxies suffer from degeneracies. We
estimate merger ages to be about 100~Myr based on the observed disturbances in
the gas distribution. Furthermore, we determine that these galaxies lie, on
average, two orders of magnitude below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for
star-forming galaxies as well as below the relation for relaxed ETGs. We
discuss potential dynamical processes responsible for this strong suppression

direction within the Galaxy. In nearby stars, with distance d < 1 kpc, the
Hercules stream is most strongly seen in higher metallicity stars [Fe/H] > 0.2.
The Hercules stream peak v value depends on viewed galactic longitude, which we
interpret as due to the gap between the stellar stream and more circular orbits
being associated with a specific angular momentum value of about 1640 km/s kpc.
The association of the gap with a particular angular momentum value supports a
bar resonant model for the Hercules stream.
  Moving groups previously identified in Hipparcos observations are easiest to
see in stars nearer than 250 pc, and their visibility and peak velocities in
the velocity distributions depends on both viewing direction (galactic
longitude and hemisphere) and metallicity. We infer that there is fine

have $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g very similar to some red giant branch (RGB) stars.
Especially for low-resolution spectroscopic studies where $T_{\rm eff}$, log g,
and [Fe/H] can only be estimated with limited precision, separating RC stars
from RGB through established method can incur ~20% contamination. Recently,
Hawkins et al. (2018) demonstrated that the additional information in
single-epoch spectra, such as the C/N ratio, can be exploited to cleanly
differentiate RC and RGB stars. In this second paper of the series, we
establish a data-driven mapping from spectral flux space to independently
determined asteroseismic parameters, the frequency and the period spacing. From
this, we identify 210,371 RC stars from the publicly available LAMOST DR3 and
APOGEE DR14 data, with ~9% of contamination. We provide an RC sample of 92,249
stars with a contamination of only ~3%, by restricting the combined analysis to
LAMOST stars with ${\rm S/N}_{\rm pix}$ > 75. This demonstrates that high-S/N,
low-resolution spectra covering a broad wavelength range can identify RC
samples at least as pristine as their high-resolution counterparts. As coming

ages and masses, incorporating absolute K magnitude ($\rm M_K$) derived from
2MASS photometry and Gaia DR1 parallax and differentiation between initial bulk
metallicity and present day surface metallicity, with allowance for
incorporating further constraints (e.g., asteroseismology) when available. As a
test, we re-computed stellar ages and masses of $\sim 4000$ stars in the solar
neighbourhood from six well-studied literature samples using both Hipparcos and
TGAS parallaxes. Our ages are found to be compatible with literature values but
with reduced uncertainties in general. The inclusion of parallax-based $\rm
M_K$ serves as an additional constraint on the derived quantities, especially
when systematic errors in stellar parameters are underestimated. We
reconstructed the age-metallicity relationship in the solar neighbourhood by
re-analysing the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey with the inclusion of TGAS-parallaxes
and initial bulk metallicity sampling. We found a flat trend for disk stars
with ages $<$11\,Gyr but with smaller scatter at all ages compared to
literature.

determination of numerous stellar labels from observed spectra, based on
fitting physical spectral models. The Payne combines a number of important
methodological aspects: it exploits the information from much of the available
spectral range; it fits all labels (stellar parameters and element abundances)
simultaneously; it uses spectral models, where the atmosphere structure and the
radiative transport are consistently calculated to reflect the stellar labels.
At its core The Payne has an approach to accurate and precise interpolation and
prediction of the spectrum in high-dimensional label-space, which is flexible
and robust, yet based on only a moderate number of ab initio models (O(1000)
for 25 labels). With a simple neural-net-like functional form and a suitable
choice of training labels, this interpolation yields a spectral flux prediction
good to $10^{-3}$ rms across a wide range of $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g (including
dwarfs and giants). We illustrate the power of this approach by applying it to
the APOGEE DR14 data set, drawing on Kurucz models with recently improved line
lists: without recalibration, we obtain physically sensible stellar parameters
as well as 15 element abundances that appear to be more precise than the
published APOGEE DR14 values. In short, The Payne is an approach that for the
first time combines all these key ingredients, necessary for progress towards
optimal modelling of survey spectra; and it leads to both precise and accurate
estimates of stellar labels, based on physical models and without
re-calibration. Both the codes and catalog are made publicly available online.

Milky Way from the detailed chemistry and kinematics of millions of stars.
Wide-field multi-fibre spectrographs are increasingly used to obtain spectral
information for huge samples of stars. Some surveys (e.g. GALAH) are attempting
to measure up to 30 separate elements per star. Stellar abundance spectroscopy
is a subtle art that requires a very high degree of spectral uniformity across
each of the fibres. However wide-field spectrographs are notoriously
non-uniform due to the fast output optics necessary to image many fibre outputs
onto the detector. We show that precise spectroscopy is possible with such
instruments across all fibres by employing a photonic comb -- a device that
produces uniformly spaced spots of light on the CCD to precisely map complex
aberrations. Aberrations are parametrized by a set of orthogonal moments with
$\sim100$ independent parameters. We then reproduce the observed image by
convolving high resolution spectral templates with measured aberrations as
opposed to extracting the spectra from the observed image. Such a forward
modeling approach also trivializes some spectroscopic reduction problems like
fibre cross-talk, and reliably extracts spectra with a resolution $\sim2.3$
times above the nominal resolution of the instrument. Our rigorous treatment of
optical aberrations also encourages a less conservative spectrograph design in
the future.

four claimed co-moving pairs are not truly co-orbiting. Eight of the 11
co-orbiting pairs have reliable stellar parameters and abundances, and we find
that three of those are quite similar in their abundance patterns, while five
have significant [Fe/H] differences. For the latter, this indicates that they
could be co-orbiting because of the general dynamical coldness of the thin

Cannon when it is fed the spectra of these intrinsically luminous supergiants
in the Magellanic Clouds, which are well outside the normal bounds of The
Cannon's training set. We find that, although the parameters are
astrophysically incorrect, the $v\sin i$ and the abundances of lithium, barium,

we add a description of the public release of radial velocities with a typical
accuracy of 0.1 km/s for 336,215 of these stars, achievable due to the large
wavelength coverage, high resolving power and good signal to noise ratio of the
observed spectra, but also because convective motions in stellar atmosphere and
gravitational redshift from the star to the observer are taken into account. In
the process we derive medians of observed spectra which are nearly noiseless,
as they are obtained from between 100 and 1116 observed spectra belonging to
the same bin with a width of 50 K in temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity, and 0.1
dex in metallicity. Publicly released 1181 median spectra have a resolving
power of 28,000 and trace the well-populated stellar types with metallicities
between -0.6 and +0.3. Note that radial velocities from GALAH are an excellent
match to the accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane derived by
Gaia for the same stars. The level of accuracy achieved here is adequate for
studies of dynamics within stellar clusters, associations and streams in the

atmospheres, and, for the first time for a large sample of M67 stars, non-local

analysis, we find a typical star-to-star scatter in the abundance ratios of
around 0.05 dex; this scatter is slightly but systematically larger when LTE is
assumed instead. We find trends in the abundance ratios with effective
temperature, indicating systematic differences in the surface abundances
between turn-off and giant stars; these trends are more pronounced when LTE is
assumed. However, in the non-LTE analysis, most of the element trends have been
flattened. Two species are exceptions to this behaviour, namely Al and Si,

Red Clump stars from \glh{} and \apg{}, we map the line-of-sight velocities

subtracting a smooth axisymmetric model for the velocity field, we study the

along the red giant branch (RGB) is sensitive to a number of parameters
including the overall metallicity, elemental abundance patterns, the efficiency
of convection, and the treatment of the surface boundary condition. Recently
there has been interest in using observational estimates of the RGB Teff to
place constraints on the mixing length parameter, a_MLT, and possible variation
with metallicity. Here we use 1D MESA stellar evolution models to explore the
sensitivity of the RGB Teff to the treatment of the surface boundary condition.
We find that different surface boundary conditions can lead to +/- 100 K
metallicity-dependent offsets on the RGB relative to one another in spite of
the fact that all models can reproduce the properties of the Sun. Moreover, for
a given atmosphere T-tau relation, we find that the RGB Teff is also sensitive
to the optical depth at which the surface boundary condition is applied in the
stellar model. Nearly all models adopt the photosphere as the location of the
surface boundary condition but this choice is somewhat arbitrary. We compare
our models to stellar parameters derived from the APOGEE-Kepler sample of first
ascent red giants and find that systematic uncertainties in the models due to
treatment of the surface boundary condition place a limit of ~100 K below which
it is not possible to make firm conclusions regarding the fidelity of the
current generation of stellar models.

orbit migration among stars in the Milky Way disk. This model parameterizes the
possible star formation and enrichment histories, radial birth profiles, and
combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital radii to
birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age $\tau$ as
$\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}~\sqrt{\tau/8{~\mathrm{Gyr}}}$. Guided by observations, we
assume that stars are born with an initially tight age--metallicity relation at
given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration,
thereby providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration
strength $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}$. We fit this model with MCMC to the observed
age--metallicity distribution of low-$\alpha$ red clump stars with
Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the
complex spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age
uncertainties. This simple model reproduces well the observed data, and we find
a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration efficiency in the Milky
Way of $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}=3.6\pm 0.1$ kpc when marginalizing over all other
model aspects. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way's main
disk is indeed rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars
migrate by about a half-mass radius over the age of the disk. The model finds
the Sun's birth radius at $\sim 5.2$ kpc. If such strong radial orbit migration
is typical, this mechanism plays indeed an important role in setting the
structural regularity of disk galaxies.

Tracks (MIST) project to assess the utility of several types of observables in
jointly measuring the age and 1D stellar model parameters in star clusters. We
begin with a pedagogical overview summarizing the effects of stellar model
parameters, such as the helium abundance, mass-loss efficiency, and the mixing
length parameter, on observational diagnostics including the color-magnitude
diagram, mass-radius relation, and surface abundances, amongst others. We find
that these parameters and the stellar age influence observables in
qualitatively distinctive, degeneracy-breaking ways. To assess the current
state of affairs, we use the recent Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) along with data
from the literature to investigate three well-studied old open
clusters---NGC6819, M67, NGC6791---as case studies. Although there is no
obvious tension between the existing observations and the MIST models for
NGC6819, there are interesting discrepancies in the cases of M67 and NGC6791.
At this time, parallax zero point uncertainties in Gaia DR2 remain one of the
limiting factors in the analysis of these clusters. With a combination of
exquisite photometry, parallax distances, and cluster memberships from Gaia at
the end of its mission, we anticipate precise and accurate ages for these and
other star clusters in the Galaxy.

increase with stellar age, commonly interpreted as vertical heating through
orbit scattering. Here we map the vertical actions of disk stars as a function
of age ($\tau\le$ 8 Gyrs) and across a large range of Galactocentric radii,
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$, drawing on APOGEE and Gaia data. We fit
$\widehat{J_z}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC},\tau )$ as a combination of the vertical
action at birth, $\widehat{J_{z,0}}$, and subsequent heating $\widehat{\Delta
J_z}_{\, {\rm 1Gyr}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ that scales as
$\tau^{\gamma(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})}$. The inferred birth temperature,
$\widehat{J_{z,0}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ is 1 kpc km/s for 3 kpc <
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ < 10 kpc, consistent with the ISM velocity dispersion;
but it rapidly rises outward, to 8 kpc km/s for $\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ = 14
kpc, likely reflecting the stars' birth in a warped or flared gas disk. We find
the heating rate $\widehat{\Delta J_z}_{\, {\rm 1Gyr}}$ to be modest and nearly
constant across all radii, 1.6 kpc km/s Gyr$^{-1}$. The stellar age dependence
$\gamma$ gently grows with Galactocentric radius, from $\gamma \simeq$ 1 for
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}\lesssim R_\odot$ to $\gamma \simeq$ 1.3 at
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ =14 kpc. The observed $J_z - \tau$ relation at all
radii is considerably steeper ($\gamma\gtrsim$ 1) than the time dependence
theoretically expected from orbit scattering, $J_z\propto t^{0.5}$. We
illustrate how this conundrum can be resolved if we also account for the fact
that at earlier epochs the scatterers were more common, and the restoring force
from the stellar disk surface mass density was low. Our analysis may re-instate
gradual orbital scattering as a plausible and viable mechanism to explain the
age-dependent vertical motions of disk stars.

discs (with respect to Fe), which are superposed in both position and velocity
space, and examine their distributions in action space. We study the
distribution of stars in the zV_z phase plane, for both V_phi and V_R, and
recover the remarkable ""phase spiral"" discovered by Gaia. We identify the
anticipated quadrupole signature in zV_z of a tilted velocity ellipsoid for
stars above and below the Galactic plane. By connecting our work with earlier
studies, we show that the phase spiral is likely to extend well beyond the
narrow solar neighbourhood cylinder in which it was found. The phase spiral is
a signature of corrugated waves that propagate through the disc, and the
associated non-equilibrium phase mixing. The radially asymmetric distribution
of stars involved in the phase spiral reveals that the corrugation, which is
mostly confined to the alpha-poor disc, grows in z-amplitude with increasing
radius. We present new simulations of tidal disturbance of the Galactic disc by
the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf. The effect on the zV_z phase plane lasts >2 Gyr
but a subsequent disc crossing wipes out the coherent structure. We find that
the phase spiral was excited < 0.5 Gyr ago by an object like Sgr with total
mass 3 x 10^10 Msun (stripped down from 5 x 10^10 Msun when it first entered
the halo) passing through the plane.

phase-space distribution of stars in the Milky Way. In cylindrical Galactic
coordinates $(R,\phi,z)$, ridge-like structures can be seen in the \vphiR{}
plane and asymmetric arch-like structures in the \vphivR{} plane. We show that
the ridges are also clearly present when the third dimension of the \vphiR{}
plane is represented by $\langle z \rangle$, $\langle V_z \rangle$, $\langle
V_R \rangle$, $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ and $\langle[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]\rangle$.
The maps suggest that stars along the ridges lie preferentially close to the
Galactic midplane ($|z|<0.2$ kpc), and have metallicity and $\alpha$ elemental
abundance similar to that of the Sun. We show that phase mixing of disrupting
spiral arms can generate both the ridges and the arches. It also generates
discrete groupings in orbital energy $-$ the ridges and arches are simply
surfaces of constant energy. We identify 8 distinct ridges in the \gaia{} data:
six of them have constant energy while two have constant angular momentum.
Given that the signature is strongest for stars close to the plane, the
presence of ridges in $\langle z \rangle$ and $\langle V_z \rangle$ suggests a
coupling between planar and vertical directions. We demonstrate, using N-body
simulations that such coupling can be generated both in isolated discs and in
discs perturbed by an orbiting satellite like the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

structure in the combined phase and chemical space in the Galactic disk. To
date, observed structure of this kind has been mostly limited to bound clusters
and moving groups. In this paper we present a new dynamical model of the
Galactic disk that takes into account the clustered nature of star formation.
This model predicts that the combined phase and chemical space is rich in
substructure, and that this structure is sensitive to both the precise nature
of clustered star formation and the large-scale properties of the Galaxy. The
model self-consistently evolves 4 billion stars over the last 5 Gyr in a
realistic potential that includes an axisymmetric component, a bar, spiral
arms, and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). All stars are born in clusters with an
observationally-motivated range of initial conditions. As direct
\textit{N}-body calculations for billions of stars is computationally
infeasible, we have developed a method of initializing star cluster particles
to mimic the effects of direct \textit{N}-body effects, while the actual orbit
integrations are treated as test particles within the analytic potential. We
demonstrate that the combination of chemical and phase space information is
much more effective at identifying truly co-natal populations than either
chemical or phase space alone. Furthermore, we show that co-moving pairs of
stars are very likely to be co-natal if their velocity separation is $< 2$ km
s$^{-1}$ and their metallicity separation is $< 0.05$ dex. The results
presented here bode well for harnessing the synergies between \textit{Gaia} and
spectroscopic surveys to reveal the assembly history of the Galactic disk.

of nucleosynthesis and transport through the interstellar medium (ISM) over
cosmic time. Multi-object and high resolution integral-field spectroscopy have
started to measure these distributions across hundreds of HII regions
individually resolved at $\lesssim 100$ pc scales in a handful of objects, but
in the coming decade these studies will expand to larger samples of galaxies.
This will allow us to understand the role of feedback and turbulence in driving
the mixing and diffusion of metals in the ISM, and statistically assess the
role of galaxy environment and disk dynamics in modifying how mixing proceeds.
Detailed searches for over- and under-enriched regions can address to what
extent star formation is triggered by previous generations of star formation
and by pristine and recycled gas flows. Local galaxies, for which these
detailed measurements will be possible within the next decade, will inform the
interpretation of integrated measurements at high-z, where very different
dynamical gas-rich environments are found in early disk galaxies. Currently,
progress in the field is severely hampered by the 0.2-0.3 dex level systematic
uncertainties plaguing nebular abundance diagnostics. Improving our detailed
understanding of ionized nebulae at $<$20 pc scales will help us find a
solution to this problem, which will prove key to the study of metal enrichment
and mixing across the galaxy population in the next decade.

evolution connection and a principal data point for near-field cosmology. Due
to its proximity (780 kpc), M31 can be resolved into individual stars like the
Milky Way (MW). Unlike the MW, we have the advantage of a global view of M31,
enabling M31 to be observed with techniques that also apply to more distant
galaxies. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that M31 may have survived a major
merger within the last several Gyr, shaping the morphology of its stellar halo
and triggering a starburst, while leaving the stellar disk largely intact. The
MW and M31 thus provide complementary opportunities for in-depth studies of the
disks, halos, and satellites of L* galaxies.
  Our understanding of the M31 system will be transformed in the 2020s if they
include wide field facilities for both photometry (HST-like sensitivity and
resolution) and spectroscopy (10-m class telescope, >1 sq. deg. field, highly
multiplexed, R~ 3000 to 6000). We focus here on the power of these facilities
to constrain the past, present, and future merger history of M31, via
chemo-dynamical analyses and star formation histories of phase-mixed stars
accreted at early times, as well as stars in surviving tidal debris features,
M31's extended disk, and intact satellite galaxies that will eventually be
tidally incorporated into the halo. This will yield an unprecedented view of
the hierarchical formation of the M31 system and the subhalos that built it
into the L* galaxy we observe today.

light on the clustered nature of star formation and the dynamical state of the
disk. In previous work we presented a set of simulations of the Galactic disk
that followed the clustered formation and dynamical evolution of 4 billion
individual stars over the last 5 Gyr. The simulations predict that a high
fraction of co-moving stars with physical and 3D velocity separation of $\Delta
r < 20$ pc and $\Delta v < 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ are co-natal. In this
\textit{Letter}, we use \textit{Gaia} DR2 and LAMOST DR4 data to identify and
study co-moving pairs. We find that the distribution of relative velocities and
separations of pairs in the data is in good agreement with the predictions from
the simulation. We identify 111 co-moving pairs in the Solar neighborhood with
reliable astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. These pairs show a strong
preference for having similar metallicities when compared to random field
pairs. We therefore conclude that these pairs were very likely born together.
The simulations predict that co-natal pairs originate preferentially from
high-mass and relatively young ($< 1$ Gyr) star clusters. \textit{Gaia} will
eventually deliver well-determined metallicities for the brightest stars,
enabling the identification of thousands of co-natal pairs due to disrupting
star clusters in the solar neighborhood.

platform for the design, execution and scientific exploitation of spectroscopic
surveys. It will unveil the composition and dynamics of the faint Universe and
impact nearly every field of astrophysics across all spatial scales, from
individual stars to the largest scale structures in the Universe. Major pillars
in the science program for MSE include (i) the ultimate Gaia follow-up facility
for understanding the chemistry and dynamics of the distant Milky Way,
including the outer disk and faint stellar halo at high spectral resolution
(ii) galaxy formation and evolution at cosmic noon, via the type of
revolutionary surveys that have occurred in the nearby Universe, but now
conducted at the peak of the star formation history of the Universe (iii)
derivation of the mass of the neutrino and insights into inflationary physics
through a cosmological redshift survey that probes a large volume of the
Universe with a high galaxy density. MSE is positioned to become a critical hub
in the emerging international network of front-line astronomical facilities,
with scientific capabilities that naturally complement and extend the
scientific power of Gaia, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Square
Kilometer Array, Euclid, WFIRST, the 30m telescopes and many more.

globular clusters using both literature measurements of sodium and aluminum and
APOGEE measurements of nitrogen and aluminum abundances. For the latter, we
show that the Payne is the most suitable of the five available abundance
pipelines for our purposes. Our combined sample of 42 globular clusters spans
approximately 2 dex in [Fe/H] and 1.5 dex in $\log{M_{GC}/M_{\odot}}$. We find
no fewer than five globular clusters with significant internal variations in
nitrogen and/or sodium with little-to-no corresponding variation in aluminum,
and that the minimum present-day cluster mass for aluminum enrichment in
metal-rich systems is $\log{M_{GC}/M_{\odot}} \approx 4.50 +
2.17(\rm{[Fe/H]}+1.30)$. We demonstrate that the slopes of the [Al/Fe] vs
[Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] vs [N/Fe] relations for stars without field-like abundances
are approximately log-linearly dependent on both the metallicity and the
stellar mass of the globular clusters. In contrast, the relationship between
[Na/Fe] and [N/Fe] shows no evidence of such dependencies. This suggests that
there were (at least) two classes of non-supernovae chemical polluters that
were common in the early universe, and that their relative contributions within
globular clusters somehow scaled with the metallicity and mass of globular
clusters. The first of these classes is predominantly responsible for the CNO
and NeNa abundance variations, and likewise the second for the MgAl abundance
variations. 47 Tuc and M4 are particularly striking examples of this dichotomy.
As an auxiliary finding, we argue that abundance variations among Terzan 5
stars are consistent with it being a normal globular cluster.

evolution because it can probe the ages of stars. Earlier attempts comparing
seismic data from the {\it Kepler} satellite with predictions from Galaxy
models found that the models predicted more low-mass stars compared to the
observed distribution of masses. It was unclear if the mismatch was due to
inaccuracies in the Galactic models, or the unknown aspects of the selection
function of the stars. Using new data from the K2 mission, which has a
well-defined selection function, we find that an old metal-poor thick disc, as
used in previous Galactic models, is incompatible with the asteroseismic
information. We show that spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H] and
[$\alpha$/Fe] elemental abundances from the GALAH survey indicate a mean
metallicity of $\log (Z/Z_{\odot})=-0.16$ for the thick disc. Here $Z$ is the
effective solar-scaled metallicity, which is a function of [Fe/H] and
[$\alpha$/Fe]. With the revised disc metallicities, for the first time, the
theoretically predicted distribution of seismic masses show excellent agreement
with the observed distribution of masses. This provides an indirect
verification of the asteroseismic mass scaling relation is good to within five
percent. Using an importance-sampling framework that takes the selection
function into account, we fit a population synthesis model of the Galaxy to the
observed seismic and spectroscopic data. Assuming the asteroseismic scaling
relations are correct, we estimate the mean age of the thick disc to be about
10 Gyr, in agreement with the traditional idea of an old $\alpha$-enhanced
thick disc.

the determination of stellar parameters and abundances of Fe, Mg, and Ti from
the medium-resolution spectra of FGK stars.} Methods We extend the Payne
fitting approach to draw on NLTE and LTE spectral models. These are used to
analyse the spectra of the Gaia-ESO benchmark stars and the spectra of 742
stars in 13 open and globular clusters in the Milky Way: NGC 3532, NGC 5927,
NGC 2243, NGC 104, NGC 1851, NGC 2808, NGC 362, M 2, MGC 6752, NGC 1904, NGC
4833, NGC 4372 and M 15. Results Our approach accurately recovers effective
temperatures, surface gravities, and abundances of the benchmark stars and
clusters members. The differences between NLTE and LTE are significant in the
metal-poor regime, [Fe/H] $\lesssim -1$. The NLTE [Fe/H] values are
systematically higher, whereas the average NLTE [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios are
$\sim 0.15$ dex lower, compared to LTE. Our LTE measurements of metallicities
and abundances of stars in Galactic clusters are in a good agreement with the
literature. Yet, for most clusters, our study yields the first estimates of
NLTE abundances of Fe, Mg and Ti. Conclusions All clusters investigated in this
work are homogeneous in Fe and Ti, with the intra-cluster abundance variations
of less than 0.04 dex. NGC 2808, NGC 4833, M 2 and M 15 show significant
dispersions in [Mg/Fe]. Contrary to common assumptions, the NLTE analysis
changes the mean abundance ratios in the clusters, but it does not influence
the intra-cluster abundance dispersions.

the $\alpha$-elements in conflict with core-collapse supernova predictions; (3)
the number and relative importance of r-process sites; (4) the origin of carbon

origin of the intermediate elements, such as Cu, Ge, As, and Se, that bridge
the region between charged-particle and neutron-capture reactions. The next
decade will bring to maturity many of the new tools that have recently made
their mark, such as large-scale chemical cartography of the Milky Way and its
satellites, the addition of astrometric and asteroseismic information, the
detection and characterization of gravitational wave events, 3-D simulations of
convection and model atmospheres, and improved laboratory measurements for
transition probabilities and nuclear masses. All of these areas are key for

Galactic archaeology. That is, to reconstruct the evolutionary narrative of the
Milky Way, based on the empirical data that describes its current
morphological, dynamical, temporal and chemical structures. Here, we describe a
path to achieving this goal. The critical observational objective is a
Galaxy-scale, contiguous, comprehensive mapping of the disk's phase space,
tracing where the majority of the stellar mass resides. An ensemble of recent,
ongoing, and imminent surveys are working to deliver such a transformative
stellar map. Once this empirical description of the dust-obscured disk is
assembled, we will no longer be operationally limited by the observational
data. The primary and significant challenge within stellar astronomy and
Galactic archaeology will then be in fully utilizing these data. We outline the
next-decade framework for obtaining and then realizing the potential of the
data to chart the Galactic disk via its stars. One way to support the
investment in the massive data assemblage will be to establish a Galactic
Archaeology Consortium across the ensemble of stellar missions. This would
reflect a long-term commitment to build and support a network of personnel in a
dedicated effort to aggregate, engineer, and transform stellar measurements
into a comprehensive perspective of our Galaxy.

For almost 2 billion common stars the combination of Gaia and a new all-sky NIR

exoplanet systems, to compact galaxies, quasars, neutron stars, binaries and

abundances for 6 million stars from $\sim$8 million low-resolution
($R\sim1800$) spectra from LAMOST DR5. This is based on a modeling approach
that we dub $The$ $Data$--$Driven$ $Payne$ ($DD$--$Payne$), which inherits
essential ingredients from both {\it The Payne} \citep{Ting2019} and $The$
$Cannon$ \citep{Ness2015}. It is a data-driven model that incorporates
constraints from theoretical spectral models to ensure the derived abundance
estimates are physically sensible. Stars in LAMOST DR5 that are in common with
either GALAH DR2 or APOGEE DR14 are used to train a model that delivers stellar
parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, $V_{\rm mic}$) and abundances for 16
elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ba) when
applied to LAMOST spectra. Cross-validation and repeat observations suggest
that, for ${\rm S/N}_{\rm pix}\ge 50$, the typical internal abundance precision
is 0.03--0.1\,dex for the majority of these elements, with 0.2--0.3\,dex for Cu
and Ba, and the internal precision of $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ is better than
30\,K and 0.07\,dex, respectively. Abundance systematics at the $\sim$0.1\,dex
level are present in these estimates, but are inherited from the
high-resolution surveys' training labels. For some elements, GALAH provides
more robust training labels, for others, APOGEE. We provide flags to guide the
quality of the label determination and to identify binary/multiple stars in
LAMOST DR5. The abundance catalogs are publicly accessible via

modelling the ages, metallicities and Galactocentric radii of APOGEE red clump
stars with 6 < R < 13 kpc. The current stellar distribution differs
significantly from that expected from the star formation history due to the
redistribution of stars through radial orbit mixing. We propose and fit a
global model for the Milky Way disk, specified by an inside-out star formation
history, radial orbit mixing, and an empirical, parametric model for its
chemical evolution. We account for the spatially complex survey selection
function, and find that the model fits all data well. We find distinct
inside-out growth of the Milky Way disk; the best fit model implies that the
half-mass radius of the Milky Way disk has grown by 43\% over the last 7 Gyr.
Yet, such inside-out growth still results in present-day age gradient weaker
than 0.1 Gyr/kpc. Our model predicts the half-mass and half-light sizes of the
Galactic disk at earlier epochs, which can be compared to the observed redshift
-size relations of disk galaxies. We show that radial orbit migration can
reconcile the distinct disk-size evolution with redshift, also expected from
cosmological simulations, with the modest present-day age gradients seen in the
Milky Way and other galaxies.

second data release of the GALAH survey, we identify two new members of the
Fimbulthul stellar stream, and chemically tag them to massive, multi-metallic
globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. Recent analysis of the second data release
of Gaia had revealed the Fimbulthul stellar stream in the halo of the Milky
Way. It had been proposed that the stream is associated with the $\omega$
Centauri, but this proposition relied exclusively upon the kinematics and
metallicities of the stars to make the association. In this work, we find our
two new members of the stream to be metal-poor stars that are enhanced in
sodium and aluminium, typical of second population globular cluster stars, but
not otherwise seen in field stars. Furthermore, the stars share the s-process
abundance pattern seen in $\omega$ Centauri, which is rare in field stars.
Apart from one star within 1.5 deg of $\omega$ Centauri, we find no other stars
observed by GALAH spatially near $\omega$ Centauri or the Fimbulthul stream
that could be kinematically and chemically linked to the cluster. Chemically
tagging stars in the Fimbulthul stream to $\omega$ Centauri confirms the
earlier work, and further links this tidal feature in the Milky Way halo to

scatter is even higher when considering the observed surface abundances. After
correcting for selection effects, the AMR appear to have intrinsic structures
indicative of two star formation events, which we speculate are connected to
the thin and thick disks in the solar neighborhood. We also present abundance
ratio trends for 16 elements as a function of age, across different $\rm

from our far larger sample to be compatible with studies based on small ($\sim$
100 stars) samples of solar twins but we now extend it to both sub- and
super-solar metallicities. The $\alpha$-elements show differing behaviour: the
hydrostatic $\alpha$-elements O and Mg show a steady decline with time for all
metallicities while the explosive $\alpha$-elements Si, Ca and Ti are nearly
constant during the thin disk epoch (ages $\lessapprox $ 12 Gyr). The s-process

stars across the Milky Way to piece together its assembly history. For this to
work, stars born together must be uniquely chemically homogeneous. Wide binary
systems are an important laboratory to test this underlying assumption. Here we
present the detailed chemical abundance patterns of 50 stars across 25 wide
binary systems comprised of main-sequence stars of similar spectral type
identified in Gaia DR2 with the aim of quantifying their level of chemical
homogeneity. Using high-resolution spectra obtained with McDonald Observatory,
we derive stellar atmospheric parameters and precise detailed chemical
abundances for light/odd-Z (Li, C, Na, Al, Sc, V, Cu), $\alpha$ (Mg, Si, Ca),
Fe-peak (Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), and neutron capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La,
Nd, Eu) elements. Results indicate that 80% (20 pairs) of the systems are
homogeneous in [Fe/H] at levels below 0.02 dex. These systems are also
chemically homogeneous in all elemental abundances studied, with offsets and
dispersions consistent with measurement uncertainties. We also find that wide
binary systems are far more chemically homogeneous than random pairings of
field stars of similar spectral type. These results indicate that wide binary
systems tend to be chemically homogeneous but in some cases they can differ in
their detailed elemental abundances at a level of [X/H] ~ 0.10 dex, overall
implying chemical tagging in broad strokes can work.

they are standard candles and give precise distances even at large distances.
However, it is difficult to cleanly select red clumps stars because they can
have the same T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ as red giant branch stars.
Recently, it was shown that the asteroseismic parameters, $\rm{\Delta}$P and
$\rm{\Delta\nu}$, which are used to accurately select red clump stars, can be
derived from spectra using the change in the surface carbon to nitrogen ratio
([C/N]) caused by mixing during the red giant branch. This change in [C/N] can
also impact the spectral energy distribution. In this study, we predict the
$\rm{\Delta}$P, $\rm{\Delta\nu}$, T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ using 2MASS,
AllWISE, \gaia, and Pan-STARRS data in order to select a clean sample of red
clump stars. We achieve a contamination rate of $\sim$20\%, equivalent to what
is achieved when selecting from T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ derived from low

contamination rate of $\sim$ 20\% and $\sim$ 405,000 red clump stars. The other

distant from its birth radius for two reasons: either its orbit has become
eccentric through radial heating, which increases its radial action $J_R$
(`blurring'); or merely its angular momentum $L_z$ has changed and thereby its
guiding radius (`churning'). We know that radial orbit migration is strong in
the Galactic low-$\alpha$ disk and set out to quantify the relative importance
of these two effects, by devising and applying a parameterized model for the
distribution $p(L_z, J_R, \tau, \mathrm[Fe/H])$ in the stellar disk. This model
describes the orbit evolution for stars of age $\tau$ and metallicity [Fe/H],
presuming coeval stars were initially born on (near-)circular orbits, and with
a unique [Fe/H] at a given birth angular momentum and age. We fit this model to
APOGEE red clump stars, accounting for the complex selection function of the
survey. The best fit model implies changes of angular momentum of
$\sqrt{\langle \Delta L_z \rangle^2} \approx 619\,
\mathrm{kpc~km/s~}(\tau/\mathrm{6~Gyr})^{0.5}$, and changes of radial action as
$\sqrt{\langle \Delta J_R \rangle^2} \approx 63\, \mathrm{kpc~km/s~}

formation truncated $10.2.^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Gyr ago ($z\simeq2$); 3) the
low-$\alpha$ population is primarily on low eccentricity orbits and the bulk of
its stars formed less than 8 Gyr ago. These results suggest a scenario in which
the Milky Way accreted a satellite galaxy at $z\approx2$ that merged with the
early disk by $z\approx1$. This merger truncated star formation in the early
high-$\alpha$ disk and perturbed a fraction of that disk onto halo-like orbits.
The merger enabled the formation of a chemically distinct, low-$\alpha$ disk at
$z\lesssim1$. The lack of any stars on halo-like orbits at younger ages
indicates that this event was the last significant disturbance to the Milky Way
disk.

telescopes with adaptive optics. This has the potential to elucidate the issue
of globular cluster formation and the origins of significantly helium-enriched
subpopulations, a problem in Galactic astronomy with no satisfactory
theoretical solution. Given this context, we use model stellar tracks and
isochrones to investigate the predicted observational properties of
helium-enriched stellar populations in globular cluster progenitors. We find
that, relative to helium-normal populations, helium-enriched
(${\Delta}Y=+0.12$) stellar populations similar to those inferred in the most
massive globular clusters, are expected, modulo some rapid fluctuations in the
first $\sim$30 Myr, to be brighter and redder in the rest frame. At fixed age,
stellar mass, and metallicity, a helium-enriched population is predicted to
converge to being $\sim$0.40 mag brighter at $\lambda \approx 2.0\, {\mu}m$,
and to be 0.30 mag redder in the \textit{JWST}-NIRCam colour $(F070W-F200W)$,
and to actually be fainter for $\lambda \lesssim 0.50 \, {\mu}m$. Separately,
we find that the time-integrated shift in ionizing radiation is a negligible
$\sim 5\%$, though we show that the Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction could end up
higher for helium-enriched stars.

discuss them in the context of proposed mechanisms for lithium enrichment and
re-depletion in giant stars. We confirm that Li-rich giants are rare, making up
only 1.2 per cent of our giant star sample. We use stellar parameters from the
third public data release from the GALAH survey and a Bayesian isochrone
analysis to divide the sample into first-ascent red giant branch and red clump
stars, and confirm these classifications using asteroseismic data from \Ktwo.
We find that red clump stars are 2.5 times as likely to be lithium-rich as red
giant branch stars, in agreement with other recent work. The probability for a
star to be lithium-rich is affected by a number of factors, though the
causality in those correlations is not entirely clear. We show for the first
time that primary and secondary red clump stars have distinctly different
lithium enrichment patterns. The data set discussed here is large and
heterogeneous in terms of evolutionary phase, metallicity, rotation rate and
mass. We expect that if the various mechanisms that have been proposed for
lithium enrichment in evolved stars are in fact active, they should all
contribute to this sample of lithium-rich giants at some level.

the LAMOST DR5 spectra analyzed by Xiang et al. (2019). They are almost
exclusively main sequence and subgiant stars with $T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim6300$K.
Their distribution in the Kiel diagram ($T_{\rm eff}$--$\log g$) traces a sharp
border at low temperatures along a roughly fixed-mass trajectory (around
$1.4M_\odot)$ that corresponds to an upper limit in convective envelope mass
fraction of around $10^{-4}$. Most of these stars exhibit distinctly enhanced
abundances of iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) but depleted abundances of Mg
and Ca. Rotational velocity measurements from GALAH DR2 show that the majority
of these stars rotate slower than typical stars in an equivalent temperature
range. These characteristics suggest that they are related to the so-called
Am/Fm stars. Their abundance patterns are qualitatively consistent with the
predictions of stellar evolution models that incorporate radiative
acceleration, suggesting they are a consequence of stellar internal evolution
particularly involving the competition between gravitational settling and
radiative acceleration. These peculiar stars constitute 40% of the whole

region of the Kiel diagram wherein lithium is severely depleted. We discovered
that stars in these two groups show similar trends in the A(Li)-[Fe/H] plane,
but with a roughly constant offset in A(Li) of 0.4 dex, the warm group having
higher Li abundances. At $\rm[Fe/H]\gtrsim-0.5$, a significant increasing in Li
abundance with increasing metallicity is evident in both groups, signalling the
onset of significant Galactic production. At lower metallicity, stars in the
cool group sit on the Spite plateau, showing a reduced lithium of around 0.4
dex relative to the primordial value predicted from Big Bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN). However, stars in the warm group between [Fe/H] = -1.0 and -0.5, form an
elevated plateau that is largely consistent with the BBN prediction. This may
indicate that these stars in fact preserve the primordial Li produced in the

statistics for non-Gaussian information. It is especially suited for fields
presenting localized structures and hierarchical clustering, such as the
cosmological density field.
  To demonstrate its power, we apply this estimator to a cosmological parameter
inference problem in the context of weak lensing. On simulated convergence maps
with realistic noise, the scattering transform outperforms classic estimators
and is on a par with state-of-the-art CNN. It retains the advantages of
traditional statistical descriptors, has provable stability properties, allows
to check for systematics, and importantly, the scattering coefficients are
interpretable. It is a powerful and attractive estimator for observational
cosmology and the study of physical fields in general.

including the high-$\alpha$ disk, the in-situ halo (disk stars heated to
eccentric orbits), Sagittarius (Sgr), $Gaia$-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), the Helmi
Streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos. Additionally, we identify the following new

a surprising 10 kpc off the plane, (ii, iii) Arjuna ([Fe/H]$=-1.2$) and I'itoi

destroy lithium over the course of their lives, via low-temperature nuclear
burning. This has now been supported by observations of hundreds of thousands
of red giant stars (Brown et al. 1989, Kumar et al. 2011, Deepak et al. 2019,
Singh et al. 2019, Casey et al. 2019). Here we perform the first large-scale
systematic investigation into the Li content of stars in the red clump phase of
evolution, which directly follows the red giant branch phase. Surprisingly we
find that all red clump stars have high levels of lithium for their
evolutionary stage. On average the lithium content increases by a factor of 40
after the end of the red giant branch stage. This suggests that all low-mass
stars undergo a lithium production phase between the tip of the red giant
branch and the red clump. We demonstrate that our finding is not predicted by
stellar theory, revealing a stark tension between observations and models. We
also show that the heavily studied (Brown et al. 1989, Reddy et al. 2005, Kumar

clustered on many scales due to both star formation and non-axisymmetries in
the Galactic potential. In this work we calculate the spatial and kinematic
two-point correlation functions using a sample of $1.7 \times 10^6$ stars
within 1 kpc of the Sun with 6D phase space information available from
\textit{Gaia} DR2. Clustering is detected on spatial scales of 1-300 pc and
velocity scales of at least 15 km s$^{-1}$. With bound structures included, the
data have a power-law index ($\xi(\Delta r) \propto \Delta r^{\gamma}$) of
$\gamma\approx-2$ at most spatial scales, which is in line with theoretical
predictions. After removing bound structures, the data have a power-law index
of $\gamma\approx-1$ for $<100$ pc and $\gamma \lesssim -1.5$ for $>100$ pc. We
interpret these results with the aid of a novel star-by-star simulation of the
Galaxy in which stars are born in clusters orbiting in a realistic potential
that includes spiral arms, a bar, and GMCs. We find that the simulation largely
agrees with the observations (within a factor of 2-3) at all spatial and
kinematic scales. In detail, the correlation function in the simulation is
shallower than the data at $< 20$ pc scales, and steeper than the data at $>
30$ pc scales. We also find a persistent clustering signal in the kinematic
correlation function for the data at large $\Delta v$ ($>5$ km s$^{-1}$) not
present in the simulations. We speculate that this mismatch between
observations and simulations may be due to two processes not included in the
simulation: hierarchical star formation and transient spiral arms. We also use
the simulations to predict the clustering signal as a function of pair-wise
metallicity and age separations. Ages and metallicities measured with a

  H3 Survey","18 pages, 12 figures, 1 table. Submitted to ApJ",,,,astro-ph.GA,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The tidal disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy has generated a
spectacular stream of stars wrapping around the entire Galaxy. We use data from
$Gaia$ and the H3 Stellar Spectroscopic Survey to identify 823 high-quality
Sagittarius members based on their angular momenta. The H3 Survey is largely
unbiased in metallicity, and so our sample of Sagittarius members is similarly
unbiased. Stream stars span a wide range in [Fe/H] from $-0.2$ to $\approx
-3.0$, with a mean overall metallicity of $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle=-0.99$. We
identify a strong metallicity-dependence to the kinematics of the stream
members. At [Fe/H]$\gt -0.8$ nearly all members belong to the well-known cold
($\sigma_v \lt 20$ km/s) leading and trailing arms. At intermediate
metallicities ($-1.9 \lt$[Fe/H]$\lt -0.8$) a significant population (24$\%$)
emerges of stars that are kinematically offset from the cold arms. These stars
also appear to have hotter kinematics. At the lowest metallicities
([Fe/H]$\lesssim-2$), the majority of stars (69$\%$) belong to this
kinematically-offset diffuse population. Comparison to simulations suggests
that the diffuse component was stripped from the Sagittarius progenitor at
earlier epochs, and therefore resided at larger radius on average, compared to
the colder metal-rich component. We speculate that this kinematically diffuse,
low metallicity, population is the stellar halo of the Sagittarius progenitor
system.

  welcome",,10.3847/1538-4365/abd6ba,,astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA astro-ph.IM,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We present a data-driven method to estimate absolute magnitudes for O- and
B-type stars from the LAMOST spectra, which we combine with {\it Gaia}
parallaxes to infer distance and binarity. The method applies a neural network
model trained on stars with precise {\it Gaia} parallax to the spectra and
predicts $K_{\rm s}$-band absolute magnitudes $M_{Ks}$ with a precision of
0.25\,mag, which corresponds to a precision of 12\% in spectroscopic distance.
For distant stars (e.g. $>5$\,kpc), the inclusion of constraints from
spectroscopic $M_{Ks}$ significantly improves the distance estimates compared
to inferences from {\it Gaia} parallax alone. Our method accommodates for
emission line stars by first identifying them via PCA reconstructions and then
treating them separately for the $M_{Ks}$ estimation. We also take into account
unresolved binary/multiple stars, which we identify through deviations in the
spectroscopic $M_{Ks}$ from the geometric $M_{Ks}$ inferred from {\it Gaia}
parallax. This method of binary identification is particularly efficient for
unresolved binaries with near equal-mass components and thus provides an useful
supplementary way to identify unresolved binary or multiple-star systems. We
present a catalog of spectroscopic $M_{Ks}$, extinction, distance, flags for
emission lines, and binary classification for 16,002 OB stars from LAMOST DR5.
As an illustration of the method, we determine the $M_{Ks}$ and distance to the
enigmatic LB-1 system, where Liu et al. (2019) had argued for the presence of a
black hole and incorrect parallax measurement, and we do not find evidence for
errorneous {\it Gaia} parallax.

plays a critical role in resolving the open question of wide binary formation.
In this paper, we investigate the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and age dependence of
the wide-binary fraction (binary separations between $10^3$ and $10^4$ AU) for
field F and G dwarfs within 500 pc by combining their metallicity and radial
velocity measurements from LAMOST DR5 with the astrometric information from
Gaia DR2. We show that the wide-binary fraction strongly depends on the
metallicity: as metallicity increases, the wide-binary fraction first
increases, peaks at [Fe/H]$\simeq 0$, and then decreases at the high
metallicity end. The wide-binary fraction at [Fe/H]$=0$ is about two times
larger than that at [Fe/H]$=-1$ and [Fe/H]$=+0.5$. This metallicity dependence
is dominated by the thin-disk stars. Using stellar kinematics as a proxy of
stellar age, we show that younger stars have a higher wide-binary fraction at
fixed metallicity close to solar. We propose that multiple formation channels
are responsible for the metallicity and age dependence. In particular, the
positive metallicity correlation at [Fe/H]$<0$ and the age dependence may be
due to the denser formation environments and higher-mass clusters at earlier
times. The negative metallicity correlation at [Fe/H]$>0$ can be inherited from
the similar metallicity dependence of close binaries, and radial migration may
play a role in enhancing the wide-binary fraction around the solar metallicity.

to study processes related to star formation and to observe young stars in the
environment they were born in. With the release of Gaia DR2, the distance
measurements to the Orion complex are now good enough that the three
dimensional structure of the complex can be explored. Here we test the
hypothesis that, due to non-trivial structure and dynamics, and age spread in
the Orion complex, the chemical enrichment of youngest stars by early
core-collapse supernovae can be observed. We obtained spectra of 794 stars of
the Orion complex with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo Australian
telescope as a part of the GALAH and GALAH-related surveys. We use the spectra
of $\sim300$ stars to derive precise atmospheric parameters and chemical
abundances of 25 elements for 15 stellar clusters in the Orion complex. We
demonstrate that the Orion complex is chemically homogeneous and that there was
no self-pollution of young clusters by core-collapse supernovae from older
clusters; with a precision of 0.02 dex in relative alpha-elements abundance and
0.06 dex in oxygen abundance we would have been able to detect pollution from a
single supernova, given a fortunate location of the SN and favourable
conditions for ISM mixing. We estimate that the supernova rate in the Orion
complex was very low, possibly producing no supernova by the time the youngest
stars of the observed population formed (from around 21 to 8 Myr ago).

that 205 have secure members that were observed by at least one of the survey.
Furthermore, members of 134 clusters have high-quality spectroscopic data that
we use to determine their chemical composition. We leverage this information to
study the chemical distribution throughout the Galactic disk of 21 elements,
from C to Eu. The radial metallicity gradient obtained from our analysis is
$-$0.076$\pm$0.009 dex kpc$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with previous works
based on smaller samples. Furthermore, the gradient in the [Fe/H] - guiding
radius (r$_{\rm guid}$) plane is $-$0.073$\pm$0.008 dex kpc$^{-1}$. We show
consistently that open clusters trace the distribution of chemical elements
throughout the Galactic disk differently than field stars. In particular, at
given radius, open clusters show an age-metallicity relation that has less
scatter than field stars. As such scatter is often interpreted as an effect of
radial migration, we suggest that these differences are due to the physical
selection effect imposed by our Galaxy: clusters that would have migrated
significantly also had higher chances to get destroyed. Finally, our results
reveal trends in the [X/Fe]$-$r$_{\rm guid}$$-$age space, which are important
to understand production rates of different elements as a function of space and
time.

large fraction of the stars near the Solar neighbourhood appear to be debris
from a single in-falling system, the so-called Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GSE).
One exciting feature of this result is that it gives astronomers for the first
time a large sample of easily observable unevolved stars that formed in an
extra-Galactic environment, which can be compared to stars that formed within
our Milky Way. Here we use these stars to investigate the ""Spite Plateau"" --
the near-constant lithium abundance observed in metal-poor dwarf stars across a
wide range of metallicities (-3<[Fe/H]<-1). In particular our aim is to test
whether the stars that formed in the GSE show a different Spite Plateau to
other Milky Way stars that inhabit the disk and halo. Individual galaxies could
have different Spite Plateaus -- e.g., the ISM could be more depleted in
lithium in a lower galactic mass system due to it having a smaller reservoir of
gas. We identified 76 GSE dwarf stars observed and analyzed by the GALactic
Archeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey as part of its Third Data Release.
Orbital actions were used to select samples of Gaia-Enceladus stars, and
comparison samples of halo and disk stars. We find that the Gaia-Enceladus
stars show the same lithium abundance as other likely accreted stars and in
situ Milky Way stars, strongly suggesting that the ""lithium problem"" is not a
consequence of the formation environment. This result fits within the growing
consensus that the Spite Plateau, and more generally the ""cosmological lithium
problem"" -- the observed discrepancy between the amount of lithium in warm,
metal-poor dwarf stars in our Galaxy, and the amount of lithium predicted to
have been produced by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis -- is the result of lithium
depletion processes within stars.

the collisionless Boltzmann equation, we then find the gravitational potential
- represented by a feed-forward neural network - that renders this distribution
function stationary. This method is far more flexible than previous parametric
methods, which fit narrow classes of analytic models to the data. This is a
promising approach to uncovering the density structure of the Milky Way, using
rich datasets of stellar kinematics that will soon become available.

200,000 dwarf stars with stellar atmospheric parameters taken from GALAH+ DR3
and with accurate, homogeneous photometry from $Gaia$ DR2, zero-point offsets
are detected in the original photometric catalog of SMSS DR2, in particular for
the gravity- and metallicity-sensitive $uv$ bands. For $uv$ bands, the
zero-point offsets are close to zero at very low extinction, and then steadily
increase with $E (B - V)$, reaching as large as 0.174 and 0.134 mag
respectively, at $E (B - V) \sim 0.5$ mag. These offsets largely arise from the
adopted dust term in the transformations used by SMSS DR2 to construct
photometric calibrators from the ATLAS reference catalog. For the $gr$ bands,
the zero-point offsets exhibit negligible variations with SFD $E(B - V )$, due
to their tiny coefficients on the dust term in the transformation. Our study
also reveals small, but significant, spatial variations of the zero-point
offsets in all $uvgr$ bands. External checks using Str\""omgren photometry, WD
loci and the SDSS Stripe 82 standard-star catalog independently confirm the
zero-points found by our revised SCR method.

eight if the possible parallax zero-point error is corrected. Most of these
HiVelSCs are metal-poor and slightly alpha-enhanced inner halo stars. Only 14%
of them have [Fe/H] > -1, which may be the metal-rich ""in situ"" stars in halo
formed in the initial collapse of the Milky Way or metal-rich stars formed in
the disk or bulge but kinematically heated. The low ratio of 14% implies that
the bulk of stellar halo was formed from the accretion and tidal disruption of
satellite galaxies. In addition, HiVelSCs on the retrograde orbits have a
slightly lower metallicities on average compared with these on the prograde
orbits, meanwhile metal-poor HiVelSCs with [Fe/H] < -1 have an even faster mean
retrograde velocity compared with metal-rich HiVelSCs. To investigate the
origins of HiVelSCs, we perform orbit integrations and divide them into four
types, i.e., hypervelocity stars, hyper-runaway stars, runaway stars and fast
halo stars. A catalog for these 591 HiVelSCs, including radial velocities,

galaxy formation and assembly. We combine data from the H3 Spectroscopic Survey
and Gaia to measure metallicities, abundances of $\alpha$ elements, stellar
ages, and orbital properties of a sample of 482 very metal-poor (VMP;
[Fe/H]$<-2$) stars in order to constrain their origins. This sample is confined
to $1\lesssim |Z| \lesssim3$ kpc from the Galactic plane. We find that >70% of
VMP stars near the disk are on prograde orbits and this fraction increases
toward lower metallicities. This result unexpected if metal-poor stars are
predominantly accreted from many small systems with no preferred orientation,
as such a scenario would imply a mostly isotropic distribution. Furthermore, we
find there is some evidence for higher fractions of prograde orbits amongst
stars with lower [$\alpha$/Fe]. Isochrone-based ages for main sequence turn-off
stars reveal that these VMP stars are uniformly old ($\approx12$ Gyr)
irrespective of the $\alpha$ abundance and metallicity, suggesting that the
metal-poor population was not born from the same well-mixed gas disk. We
speculate that the VMP population has a heterogeneous origin, including both
in-situ formation in the ancient disk and accretion from a satellite with the
same direction of rotation as the ancient disk at early times. Our precisely
measured ages for these VMP stars on prograde orbits show that the Galaxy has
had a relatively quiescent merging history over most of cosmic time, and
implies the angular momentum alignment of the Galaxy has been in place for at
least 12 Gyr.

With
improved proper motions provided by Gaia EDR3, we show that the orbits of 23
Galactic stellar streams are highly clustered in orbital phase space. Based on
their energies and angular momenta, most streams in our sample can plausibly be
associated with a specific (disrupted) dwarf galaxy host that brought them into
the Milky Way. For eight streams we also identify likely globular cluster
progenitors (four of these associations are reported here for the first time).
Some of these stream progenitors are surprisingly far apart, displaced from
their tidal debris by a few to tens of degrees. We identify stellar streams
that appear spatially distinct, but whose similar orbits indicate they likely
originate from the same progenitor. If confirmed as physical discontinuities,
they will provide strong constraints on the mass-loss from the progenitor. The
nearly universal ex-situ origin of existing stellar streams makes them valuable
tracers of galaxy mergers and dynamical friction within the Galactic halo.
Their phase-space clustering can be leveraged to construct a precise global map
of dark matter in the Milky Way, while their internal structure may hold clues
to the small-scale structure of dark matter in their original host galaxies.

Its third data release provides reduced spectra with new derivations of stellar
parameters and abundances of 30 chemical elements for 584,015 dwarfs and
giants, 88% of them in the Gaia magnitude range 11 < G < 14. Here we use these
improved values of stellar parameters to build a library of observed spectra
which is useful to study variations of individual spectral lines with stellar
parameters. This and other improvements are used to derive radial velocities
with uncertainties which are generally within 0.1 km/s or ~25% smaller than in
the previous release. Median differences in radial velocities measured here and
by the Gaia DR2 or APOGEE DR16 surveys are smaller than 30 m/s, a larger offset
is present only for Gaia measurements of giant stars. We identify 4483 stars
with intrinsically variable velocities and 225 stars for which the velocity
stays constant over >=3 visits spanning more than a year. The combination of
radial velocities from GALAH+ with distances and sky plane motions from Gaia
enables studies of dynamics within streams and clusters. For example, we
estimate that the open cluster M67 has a total mass of ~3300 Msun and its outer
parts seem to be expanding, though astrometry with a larger time-span than
currently available from Gaia eDR3 is needed to judge if the latter result is
real.

5-7 significant dimensions, but others show that many elemental abundances can
be predicted to high accuracy from [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] (or [Fe/H] and age)
alone. We show that both propositions can be, and are, simultaneously true. We
adopt a machine learning technique known as normalizing flow to reconstruct the
probability distribution of Milky Way disk stars in the space of 15 elemental
abundances measured by APOGEE. Conditioning on Teff and log g minimizes the
differential systematics. After further conditioning on [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], the
residual scatter for most abundances is $\sigma_{[X/{\rm H}]} \lesssim 0.02$
dex, consistent with APOGEE's reported statistical uncertainties of
$\sim$0.01-0.015 dex and intrinsic scatter of 0.01-0.02 dex. Despite the small
scatter, residual abundances display clear correlations between elements, which
we show are too large to be explained by measurement uncertainties or by the
finite sampling noise. We must condition on at least seven elements to reduce
correlations to a level consistent with observational uncertainties. Our
results demonstrate that cross-element correlations are a much more sensitive
probe of hidden structure than dispersion, and they can be measured precisely
in a large sample even if star-by-star measurement noise is comparable to the
intrinsic scatter. We conclude that many elements have an independent story to
tell, even for the ""mundane"" disk stars and elements produced by core-collapse
and Type Ia supernovae. The only way to learn these lessons is to measure the
abundances directly, and not merely infer them.

data to argue that GSE entered the Galaxy on a retrograde orbit based on a
population of highly retrograde stars with chemistry similar to the largely
radial GSE debris. We present the first tailored, high-resolution N-body
simulations of the merger. From a grid of ~500 simulations we find a GSE with
$M_{*}=5\times10^{8}\ M_{\odot}, M_{\rm{DM}}=2\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ (a 2.5:1
total mass merger) best matches the H3 data. This simulation shows the
retrograde GSE stars are stripped from its outer disk early in the merger
before the orbit loses significant angular momentum. Despite being selected
purely on angular momenta and radial distributions, this simulation reproduces
and explains the following empirical phenomena: (i) the elongated, triaxial
shape of the inner halo (axis ratios $10:7.9:4.5$), whose major axis is at
~35{\deg} to the plane and connects GSE's apocenters, (ii) the Hercules-Aquila
Cloud & the Virgo Overdensity, which arise due to apocenter pile-up, (iii) the
2 Gyr lag between the quenching of GSE and the truncation of the age
distribution of the in-situ halo, which tracks the 2 Gyr gap between the first
and final GSE pericenters. We make the following predictions: (i) the inner
halo has a ""double-break"" density profile with breaks at both ~15-18 kpc and 30
kpc, coincident with the GSE apocenters, (ii) the outer halo has retrograde
streams containing ~10% of GSE stars awaiting discovery at >30 kpc. The
retrograde (radial) GSE debris originates from its outer (inner) disk --
exploiting this trend we reconstruct the stellar metallicity gradient of GSE
($-0.04\pm0.01$ dex $r_{\rm{50}}^{-1}$). These simulations imply GSE delivered
~20% of the Milky Way's present-day dark matter and ~50% of its stellar halo.

of individual accretion events that built up the Milky Way and its halo. One of
these newly identified features, called Nyx, was announced as an accreted

elemental abundances and stellar parameters from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys,
we find that the abundances of the highest likelihood Nyx members are entirely
consistent with membership of the thick disk, and inconsistent with a dwarf
galaxy origin. We conclude that the postulated Nyx stream is most probably a
high-velocity component of the Milky Way's thick disk. With the growing
availability of large data sets including kinematics, stellar parameters, and
detailed abundances, the probability of detecting chance associations
increases, and hence new searches for substructure require confirmation across

need stronger constraints on the properties of the putative star clusters,
including their assumed sizes as well as the fraction of stars that would be
compact remnants.

  Utility in Measuring the Galactic Potential","13 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to ApJ -- comments welcome",,,,astro-ph.GA,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we present a holistic view of the detection, characterization,
and origin of stellar streams in the disk of a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy.
The star-by-star simulation of the Galaxy evolves stars born in clusters in a
realistic galactic potential that includes spiral arms, a bar, and giant
molecular clouds over $5$ Gyr. We first devise a new hybrid method to detect
stellar streams that combines phase space density information along with the
action-angle space spanned by stars in our simulation. We find that streams'
progenitor star clusters and associations are all preferentially higher-mass
($>1000$ $M_{\odot}$) and young ($< 1$ Gyr). Our stream-finding method predicts
that we might be able to find anywhere from $1$ to $10$ streams with 6D
\textit{Gaia} DR2 data in the solar neighborhood alone. The simulation suggests
that streams are sensitive to the initial dynamical state of clusters,
accumulated energy gain from encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and
present-day actions. We investigate what we can learn about the Galactic
potential by studying the feasiblity of rewinding stellar streams back to their
origin. Even with perfect information about the non-axisymmetric components
(spiral arms, bar) of the galactic potential, the stochastic GMC population
makes backwards integration impossible beyond one or two disk orbital times.
Streams are also sensitive to the properties of the bar, but fairly insensitive
to the properties of the non-transient two-armed spiral in our simulation.
Finally we predict that around $10$ to $30$ stellar streams should be
detectable with \textit{Gaia}'s 10-year end-of-mission data. There are many
more stellar streams waiting to be discovered in the Galactic disk, and they
could hold clues about the history of the Galaxy for the past Gyr.

hot, OBA stars with effective temperature (Teff) higher than 7500K. This fills
a gap in the scientific analysis of large spectroscopic stellar surveys such as
LAMOST, which offers spectra for millions of stars at R=1800. We first explore
the theoretical information content of such spectra for determining stellar
labels, via the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We show that in the limit of perfect model
spectra and observed spectra with S/N of 100, precise estimates are possible
for a wide range of stellar labels: not only the effective temperature Teff,
surface gravity logg, and projected rotation velocity vsini, but also the
micro-turbulence velocity, Helium abundance and the elemental abundances [C/H],
[N/H], [O/H], [Si/H], [S/H], and [Fe/H]. Our analysis illustrates that the
temperature regime of around 9500K is challenging, as the dominant Balmer and
Paschen line strength vary little with Teff. We implement the simultaneous
fitting of these 11 stellar labels to LAMOST hot-star spectra using the Payne
approach, drawing on Kurucz's ATLAS12/SYNTHE LTE spectra as the underlying
models. We then obtain stellar parameter estimates for a sample of about
330,000 hot stars with LAMOST spectra, an increase by about two orders of
magnitude in sample size. Among them, about 260,000 have good Gaia parallaxes
(S/N>5), and more than 95 percent of them are luminous stars, mostly on the
main sequence; the rest reflects lower luminosity evolved stars, such as hot
subdwarfs and white dwarfs. We show that the fidelity of the abundance
estimates is limited by the systematics of the underlying models, as they do
not account for NLTE effects. Finally, we show the detailed distribution of
vsini of stars with 8000-15,000K, illustrating that it extends to a sharp
cut-off at the critical rotation velocity, across a wide range of temperatures.

""prompt"" component tracing core collapse supernovae and a ""delayed"" component
tracing Type Ia supernovae. For each sample star, we fit the amplitudes of
these two components, then compute the residuals \Delta[X/H] from this
two-parameter fit. The rms residuals range from ~0.01-0.03 dex for the most
precisely measured APOGEE abundances to ~0.1 dex for Na, V, and Ce. The
correlations of residuals reveal a complex underlying structure, including a
correlated element group comprised of Ca, Na, Al, K, Cr, and Ce and a separate

2-process model reveals a rich variety of physical outliers and sometimes
subtle measurement errors. Residual abundances allow comparison of populations
controlled for differences in metallicity and [\alpha/Fe]. Relative to the main

atomic diffusion might influence the observed abundance patterns. We conduct a
strictly line-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of 7 binary
systems. Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances are obtained
with extremely high precision (< 3.5%) using the high quality spectra from
VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES. We find that 4 of 7 binary systems show subtle
abundance differences (0.01 - 0.03 dex) without clear correlations with the
condensation temperature, including two planet-hosting pairs. The other 3
binary systems exhibit similar degree of abundance differences correlating with
the condensation temperature. We do not find any clear relation between the
abundance differences and the occurrence of known planets in our systems.
Instead, the overall abundance offsets observed in the binary systems (4 of 7)
could be due to the effects of atomic diffusion. Although giant planet
formation does not necessarily imprint chemical signatures onto the host star,
the differences in the observed abundance trends with condensation temperature,
on the other hand, are likely associated with diverse histories of planet
formation (e.g., formation location). Furthermore, we find a weak correlation
between abundance differences and binary separation, which may provide a new
constraint on the formation of binary systems.

enhanced giant stars with unexpected high masses ($\gtrsim$1 $M_\odot$) from
asteroseismic analysis and spectroscopy. Assuming single-star evolution, their
masses imply young ages ($\tau<6$Gyr) incompatible with the canonical Galactic
chemical evolution scenario. Here we study the chemistry and kinematics of a
large sample of such $\alpha$-rich, high-mass red giant branch (RGB) stars
drawn from the LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Using LAMOST and Gaia, we found
these stars share the same kinematics as the canonical high-$\alpha$ old
stellar population in the Galactic thick disk. The stellar abundances show that
these high-$\alpha$ massive stars have $\alpha$- and iron-peak element
abundances similar to those of the high-$\alpha$ old thick disk stars. However,
a portion of them exhibit higher [(N+C)/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] ratios, which implies
they have gained C- and Ba-rich materials from extra sources, presumably
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companions. The results support the previous
suggestion that these RGB stars are products of binary evolution. Their high
masses thus mimic ""young"" single stars, yet in fact they belong to an intrinsic
old stellar population. To fully explain the stellar abundance patterns of our
sample stars, a variety of binary evolution channels, such as, main-sequence
(MS) + RGB, MS + AGB, RGB + RGB and RGB + AGB, are required, pointing to
diverse formation mechanisms of these seemly rejuvenated cannibals. With this
larger sample, our results confirm earlier findings that most, if not all,
$\alpha$-rich stars in the Galactic disk seem to be old.

demonstrate that the chosen method of identifying star-forming galaxies
introduces a systematic uncertainty in the inferred normalization and width of

$\sim0.2$ dex respectively. To avoid this systematic, we instead parameterize
the density of the full galaxy population in the logM$^*$-logSFR-redshift plane
using a flexible neural network known as a normalizing flow. The resulting
star-forming sequence has a low-mass slope near unity and a much flatter slope
at higher masses, with a normalization $0.2-0.5$ dex lower than typical
inferences in the literature. We show this difference is due to the
sophistication of the Prospector stellar populations modeling: the
nonparametric star formation histories naturally produce higher masses while
the combination of individualized metallicity, dust, and star formation history
constraints produce lower star formation rates than typical UV+IR formulae. We
introduce a simple formalism to understand the difference between SFRs inferred
from spectral energy distribution fitting and standard template-based
approaches such as UV+IR SFRs. Finally, we demonstrate the inferred
star-forming sequence is consistent with predictions from theoretical models of

identify 800 high-confidence (a contamination rate of 4%) wide binaries and two
resolved triples, with binary separations mostly between $10^3$-$10^5$ AU and a
lowest [Fe/H] of $-2.7$. Based on their Galactic kinematics, 33 of them are
halo wide binaries, and most of those are associated with the accreted

decreases toward the low metallicity end, consistent with the previous findings
for the thin disk. Our key finding is that the halo wide binary fraction is
consistent with the thick-disk stars at a fixed [Fe/H]. There is no significant
dependence of the wide binary fraction on the $\alpha$-captured abundance.
Therefore, the wide binary fraction is mainly determined by the iron abundance,
not their disk or halo origin nor the $\alpha$-captured abundance. Our results
suggest that the formation environments play a major role for the wide binary
fraction, instead of other processes like radial migration that only apply to

orbital periods. With Gaia's high-precision astrometric measurements,
eccentricity of a wide binary can be constrained by the angle between the
separation vector and the relative velocity vector (the $v$-$r$ angle). In this
paper, by using the $v$-$r$ angles of wide binaries in Gaia Early Data Release
3, we develop a Bayesian approach to measure the eccentricity distribution as a
function of binary separations. Furthermore, we infer the eccentricities of
individual wide binaries and make them publicly available. Our results show
that the eccentricity distribution of wide binaries at $10^2$ AU is close to
uniform and becomes superthermal at $>10^{3}$ AU, suggesting two formation
mechanisms dominating at different separation regimes. The close binary
formation, most likely disk fragmentation, results in a uniform eccentricity
distribution at $<10^{2}$ AU. The wide binary formation that leads to highly
eccentric wide binaries at $>10^{3}$ AU may be turbulent fragmentation and/or

research, remains uncertain within a factor of two. Until recently, most
studies have used dynamical tracers in the inner regions of the halo, relying
on extrapolations to estimate the mass of the Milky Way. In this paper, we
extend the hierarchical Bayesian model applied in Eadie & Juri\'c (2019) to
study the mass distribution of the Milky Way halo; the new model allows for the
use of all available 6D phase-space measurements. We use kinematic data of halo
stars out to $142~{\rm kpc}$, obtained from the H3 Survey and $\textit{Gaia}$
EDR3, to infer the mass of the Galaxy. Inference is carried out with the
No-U-Turn sampler, a fast and scalable extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We
report a median mass enclosed within $100~{\rm kpc}$ of $\rm M(<100 \; kpc) =
0.69_{-0.04}^{+0.05} \times 10^{12} \; M_\odot$ (68% Bayesian credible
interval), or a virial mass of $\rm M_{200} = M(<216.2_{-7.5}^{+7.5} \; kpc) =
1.08_{-0.11}^{+0.12} \times 10^{12} \; M_\odot$, in good agreement with other
recent estimates. We analyze our results using posterior predictive checks and
find limitations in the model's ability to describe the data. In particular, we
find sensitivity with respect to substructure in the halo, which limits the
precision of our mass estimates to $\sim 15\%$.

ancient merger, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, estimated to have occurred ~8 Gyr ago.
Follow-up studies have associated GSE with a large-scale tilt in the stellar
halo that links two well-known stellar over-densities in diagonally opposing
octants of the Galaxy (the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and Virgo Overdensity; HAC and
VOD). In this paper, we study the plausibility of such unmixed merger debris
persisting over several Gyr in the Galactic halo. We employ the simulated
stellar halo from Naidu et al. (2021), which reproduces several key properties
of the merger remnant, including the large-scale tilt. By integrating the
orbits of these simulated stellar halo particles, we show that adoption of a
spherical halo potential results in rapid phase mixing of the asymmetry.
However, adopting a tilted halo potential preserves the initial asymmetry in
the stellar halo for many Gyr. The asymmetry is preserved even when a realistic
growing disk is added to the potential. These results suggest that HAC and VOD
are long-lived structures that are associated with GSE and that the dark matter
halo of the Galaxy is tilted with respect to the disk and aligned in the
direction of HAC-VOD. Such halo-disk misalignment is common in modern
cosmological simulations. Lastly, we study the relationship between the local
and global stellar halo in light of a tilted global halo comprised of highly
radial orbits. We find that the local halo offers a dynamically biased view of
the global halo due to its displacement from the Galactic Center.

(SDSS-V), with a central focus on stellar spectroscopy. In particular, SDSS-V
Milky Way Mapper program will deliver multi-epoch optical and near-infrared
spectra for more than 5 million stars across the entire sky, covering a large
range in stellar mass, surface temperature, evolutionary stage, and age. About
10% of those spectra will be of hot stars of OBAF spectral types, for whose
analysis no established survey pipelines exist. Here we present the spectral
analysis algorithm, Zeta-Payne, developed specifically to obtain stellar labels
from SDSS-V spectra of stars with these spectral types and drawing on machine
learning tools. We provide details of the algorithm training, its test on
artificial spectra, and its validation on two control samples of real stars.
Analysis with Zeta-Payne leads to only modest internal uncertainties in the
near-IR with APOGEE (optical with BOSS): 3-10% (1-2%) for Teff, 5-30% (5-25%)
for v*sin(i), 1.7-6.3 km/s(0.7-2.2 km/s) for RV, $<0.1$ dex ($<0.05$ dex) for
log(g), and 0.4-0.5 dex (0.1 dex) for [M/H] of the star, respectively. We find
a good agreement between atmospheric parameters of OBAF-type stars when
inferred from their high- and low-resolution optical spectra. For most stellar
labels the APOGEE spectra are (far) less informative than the BOSS spectra of
these stars, while log(g), v*sin(i), and [M/H] are in most cases too uncertain
for meaningful astrophysical interpretation. This makes BOSS low-resolution
optical spectra better for stellar labels of OBAF-type stars, unless the latter
are subject to high levels of extinction.

Dawn will reveal insights into the properties of the first galaxies and advance
cosmological parameter estimation. Until recently, the primary focus for
astrophysical parameter inference from the 21-cm signal centred on the power
spectrum (PS). However, the cosmic 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian
rendering the PS sub-optimal for characterising the cosmic signal. In this
work, we introduce a new technique to analyse the non-Gaussian information in
images of the 21-cm signal called the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST). This
approach closely mirrors that of convolutional neural networks with the added
advantage of not requiring tuning or training of a neural network. Instead, it
compresses the 2D spatial information into a set of coefficients making it
easier to interpret while also providing a robust statistical description of
the non-Gaussian information contained in the cosmic 21-cm signal. First, we
explore the application of the WST to mock 21-cm images to gain valuable
physical insights by comparing to the known behaviour from the 21-cm PS. Then
we quantitatively explore the WST applied to the 21-cm signal by extracting
astrophysical parameter constraints using Fisher Matrices from a realistic 1000
hr mock observation with the Square Kilometre Array. We find that: (i) the WST
applied only to 2D images can outperform the 3D spherically averaged 21-cm PS,
(ii) the excision of foreground contaminated modes can degrade the constraining
power by a factor of ~1.5-2 with the WST and (iii) higher cadences between the
21-cm images can further improve the constraining power.

kinematics determined from H3 Survey spectroscopy and Gaia astrometry to
identify the birth of the Galactic disk. We separate in-situ and accreted stars
on the basis of angular momenta and eccentricities. The sequence of high-alpha
in-situ stars persists down to at least [Fe/H]=-2.5 and shows unexpected
non-monotonic behavior: with increasing metallicity the population first
declines in [alpha/Fe], then increases over the range -1.3<[Fe/H]<-0.7, and
then declines again at higher metallicities. The number of stars in the in-situ
population rapidly increases above [Fe/H]=-1. The average kinematics of these
stars are hot and independent of metallicity at [Fe/H]<-1 and then become
increasingly cold and disk-like at higher metallicities. The ages of the
in-situ, high-alpha stars are uniformly very old (13 Gyr) at [Fe/H]<-1.3, and
span a wider range (8-12 Gyr) at higher metallicities. Interpreting the
chemistry with a simple chemical evolution model suggests that the
non-monotonic behavior is due to a significant increase in star formation
efficiency, which began 13 Gyr ago. These results support a picture in which
the first 1 Gyr of the Galaxy was characterized by a ""simmering phase"" in which
the star formation efficiency was low and the kinematics had substantial
disorder with some net rotation. The disk then underwent a dramatic
transformation to a ""boiling phase"", in which the star formation efficiency
increased substantially, the kinematics became disk-like, and the number of
stars formed increased tenfold. We interpret this transformation as the birth
of the Galactic disk at z~4. The physical origin of this transformation is
unclear and does not seem to be reproduced in current galaxy formation models.

determine the spatial distribution of matter - both baryonic and dark -
throughout the Galaxy. We present a novel method for determining the
gravitational field from a snapshot of the phase-space positions of stars,
based only on minimal physical assumptions, which makes use of recently
developed tools from the field of deep learning. We first train a normalizing
flow on a sample of observed six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of stars,
obtaining a smooth, differentiable approximation of the distribution function.
Using the Collisionless Boltzmann Equation, we then find the gravitational
potential - represented by a feed-forward neural network - that renders this
distribution function stationary. This method, which we term ""Deep Potential,""
is more flexible than previous parametric methods, which fit restricted classes
of analytic models of the distribution function and potential to the data. We
demonstrate Deep Potential on mock datasets, and demonstrate its robustness
under various non-ideal conditions. Deep Potential is a promising approach to
mapping the density of the Milky Way and other stellar systems, using rich
datasets of stellar positions and kinematics now being provided by Gaia and
ground-based spectroscopic surveys.

wide binaries, with mass ratio $q\gtrsim 0.95$, extending to separations of at
least 1000 AU. The origin of this population is an enigma: twin binaries are
thought to form via correlated accretion in circumbinary disks, but the typical
observed protostellar disks have radii of $\sim100$ AU, far smaller than the
separations of the widest twins. Here, we infer the eccentricity distribution
of wide twins from the distribution of their $v$-$r$ angles, i.e., the angle
between the components' separation and relative velocity vectors. We find that
wide twins must be on extremely eccentric orbits. For the excess-twin
population at 400-1000 AU, we infer a near-delta function excess of
high-eccentricity system, with eccentricity $0.95 \lesssim e \leq 1$. These
high eccentricities for wide twins imply pericenter distances of order $10$ AU
and suggest that their orbits were scattered via dynamical interactions in
their birth environments, consistent with a scenario in which twins are born in
circumbinary disks and subsequently widened. These results further establish
twin wide binaries as a distinct population and imply that wide twins can be
used as a probe of the dynamical history of stellar populations.

measure masses for hundreds of long-period and free-floating planets. Together,
the transit and the microlensing telescopes will revolutionize our

nucleosynthetic yields of the first generations of stars. Previous studies of
CEMP stars have primarily concentrated on the Galactic halo, but more recently
they have also been detected in the thick disk and bulge components of the
Milky Way. $Gaia$ DR3 has provided an unprecedented sample of over 200 million
low-resolution ($R\approx$ 50) spectra from the BP and RP photometers. Training
on the CEMP catalog from the SDSS/SEGUE database, we use XGBoost to identify
the largest all-sky sample of CEMP candidate stars to date. In total, we find
58,872 CEMP star candidates, with an estimated contamination rate of 12%. When
comparing to literature high-resolution catalogs, we positively identify 60-68%
of the CEMP stars in the data, validating our results and indicating a high
completeness rate. Our final catalog of CEMP candidates spans from the inner to
outer Milky Way, with distances as close as $r \sim$ 0.8 kpc from the Galactic
center, and as far as $r >$ 30 kpc. Future higher-resolution spectroscopic
follow-up of these candidates will provide validations of their classification
and enable investigations of the frequency of CEMP-$s$ and CEMP-no stars
throughout the Galaxy, to further constrain the nature of their progenitors.

particular, our study demonstrates that Mendis can robustly capture the pixel
correlations in the spectra leading to the possibility of detecting unknown
atomic transitions from stellar spectra. The probabilistic nature of Mendis
also enables a rigorous determination of outliers in extensive spectroscopic
surveys without the need to measure elemental abundances through existing

achieves state-of-the-art performance for quasar continuum prediction robustly

the recently discovered high-energy stream Typhon. Typhon stars have apocenters
>100 kpc, making this the first detailed chemical picture of the Milky Way's
very distant stellar halo. Though the sample size is limited, we find that
Typhon's chemical abundances are more like a dwarf galaxy than a globular
cluster, showing a metallicity dispersion and no presence of multiple stellar
populations. Typhon stars display enhanced $\alpha$-element abundances and
increasing r-process abundances with increasing metallicity. The high-$\alpha$
abundances suggest a short star formation duration for Typhon, but this is at
odds with expectations for the distant Milky Way halo and the presence of
delayed r-process enrichment. If the progenitor of Typhon is indeed a new dwarf
galaxy, possible scenarios explaining this apparent contradiction include a
dynamical interaction that increases Typhon's orbital energy, a burst of
enhanced late-time star formation that raises [$\alpha$/Fe], and/or group
preprocessing by another dwarf galaxy before infall into the Milky Way.
Alternatively, Typhon could be the high-energy tail of a more massive disrupted
dwarf galaxy that lost energy through dynamical friction. We cannot clearly
identify a known low-energy progenitor of Typhon in the Milky Way, but 70% of
high-apocenter stars in cosmological simulations are from high-energy tails of
large dwarf galaxies. Typhon's surprising combination of kinematics and
chemistry thus underscores the need to fully characterize the dynamical history
and detailed abundances of known substructures before identifying the origin of
new substructures.

detection of this 21-cm signal is through a statistical measurement of the
spatial fluctuations using the 21-cm power spectrum (PS). However, the 21-cm
signal is non-Gaussian meaning the PS, which only measures the Gaussian
fluctuations, is sub-optimal for characterising all of the available
information. The upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will perform a deep,

stability with respect to statistical noise for measuring non-Gaussian
information, unlike the bispectrum whose statistical noise diverges. We
introduce a novel method to isolate this non-Gaussian information from mock
21-cm images and demonstrate its detection at 150 (177)~MHz ($z\sim8.5$ and
$\sim7$) for a fiducial model with signal-to-noise of $\sim$5~(8) assuming

characterized it with Gaia astrometry and follow-up spectroscopy. Specter is a
$25^\circ \times 1^\circ$ stream of stars that is entirely invisible until
strict kinematic cuts are applied to remove the Galactic foreground. The
spectroscopic members suggest a stellar age $\tau \gtrsim 12$ Gyr and a mean

significant intrinsic metallicity dispersion $\sigma_{ \text{[Fe/H]}} =
0.37_{-0.13}^{+0.21}$. We therefore argue that Specter is the disrupted remnant
of an ancient dwarf galaxy. With an integrated luminosity $M_{\text{V}} \approx
-2.6$, Specter is by far the least-luminous dwarf galaxy stream known. We
estimate that dozens of similar streams are lurking below the detection
threshold of current search techniques, and conclude that spectroscopic surveys
offer a novel means to identify extremely low surface brightness structures.

stellar halo of our Galaxy (\textit{Gaia}-Sausage-Enceladus, GSE). Using
chemical abundances and kinematics from the H3 Survey, we identify 5559 halo
stars from this merger in the radial range $r_{\text{Gal}}=6-60\text{ kpc}$. We
forward model the full selection function of H3 to infer the density profile of
this accreted component of the stellar halo. We consider a general ellipsoid
with principal axes allowed to rotate with respect to the Galactocentric axes,
coupled with a multiply-broken power law. The best-fit model is a triaxial
ellipsoid (axes ratios 10:8:7) tilted $25^\circ$ above the Galactic plane
towards the Sun and a doubly-broken power law with breaking radii at 12 kpc and
28 kpc. This result resolves the long-standing dichotomy in literature values
of the halo breaking radius, being at either $\sim15\text{ kpc}$ or
$\sim30\text{ kpc}$ assuming a singly-broken power law. N-body simulations
suggest that the breaking radii are connected to apocenter pile-ups of stellar
orbits, and so the observed double-break provides new insight into the initial
conditions and evolution of the GSE merger. Furthermore, the tilt and
triaxiality of the stellar halo could imply that a fraction of the underlying
dark matter halo is also tilted and triaxial. This has important implications
for dynamical mass modeling of the Galaxy as well as direct dark matter
detection experiments.

kinematics of a recent merger - a galactic immigration event - in exquisite
detail. Of the 11,416 sources studied in 3.75 hour of on-sky exposure time,
7,438 are M31 sources with well measured radial velocities. The observations
reveal intricate coherent kinematic structure in the positions and velocities
of individual stars: streams, wedges, and chevrons. While hints of coherent
structures have been previously detected in M31, this is the first time they
have been seen with such detail and clarity in a galaxy beyond the Milky Way.
We find clear kinematic evidence for shell structures in the Giant Stellar
Stream, the Northeast Shelf and Western Shelf regions. The kinematics are
remarkably similar to the predictions of dynamical models constructed to
explain the spatial morphology of the inner halo. The results are consistent
with the interpretation that much of the substructure in the inner halo of M31
is produced by a single galactic immigration event 1 - 2 Gyr ago. Significant
numbers of metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]$>-0.5$) are present in all of the detected
substructures, suggesting that the immigrating galaxy had an extended star
formation history. We also investigate the ability of the shells and Giant
Stellar Stream to constrain the gravitational potential of M31, and estimate
the mass within a projected radius of 125 kpc to be ${\rm log_{10}}\, M_{\rm
NFW}(<125\,{\rm kpc})/M_\odot = 11.80_{-0.10}^{+0.12}$. The results herald a
new era in our ability to study stars on a galactic scale and the immigration

examining the denoised age-metallicity relationship of the Galactic disc stars,
we identify a drop in metallicity with an increase in [Mg/Fe] at an early

decreasing [Mg/Fe]. This result is congruent with the chemical evolution
induced by an early-epoch gas-rich merger identified in the Milky Way-like

Auriga 18 there is a drop in metallicity due to the merger diluting the metal

suggest that the last massive merger of our Galaxy, the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus,

predicting the intrinsic quasar continua has bottlenecked their usage. Existing
methods of quasar continuum recovery often rely on a limited number of
high-quality quasar spectra, which might not capture the full diversity of the
quasar population. In this study, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic
model, \textit{Quasar Factor Analysis} (QFA), which combines factor analysis
(FA) with physical priors of the intergalactic medium (IGM) to overcome these
limitations. QFA captures the posterior distribution of quasar continua through
generatively modeling quasar spectra. We demonstrate that QFA can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, $\sim 2\%$ relative error, for continuum
prediction in the Ly$\alpha$ forest region compared to previous methods. We
further fit 90,678 $2<\mathrm{z}<3.5$, SNR$>2$ quasar spectra from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 and found that for $\sim 30\%$ quasar
spectra where the continua were ill-determined with previous methods, QFA
yields visually more plausible continua. QFA also attains $\lesssim 1\%$ error
in the 1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum measurements at $\mathrm{z}\sim 3$ and
$\sim 4\%$ in $\mathrm{z}\sim 2.4$. In addition, QFA determines latent factors
representing more physically motivated than PCA. We investigate the evolution
of the latent factors and report no significant redshift or luminosity
dependency except for the Baldwin effect. The generative nature of QFA also
enables outlier detection robustly; we showed that QFA is effective in
selecting outlying quasar spectra, including damped Ly$\alpha$ systems and
potential Type II quasar spectra.

could lie at greater distances, forming substructures in the outer halo. Here
we derive metallicities and distances using Gaia DR3 XP spectra for an all-sky
sample of luminous red giant stars, and map the outer halo with kinematics and
metallicities out to $100$ kpc. We obtain follow-up spectra of stars in two
strong overdensities - including the previously identified Outer Virgo
Overdensity - and find them to be relatively metal-rich and on predominantly
retrograde orbits, matching predictions from simulations of the GSE merger. We
argue that these are apocentric shells of GSE debris, forming $60-90$ kpc
counterparts to the $15-20$ kpc shells that are known to dominate the inner
stellar halo. Extending our search across the sky with literature radial
velocities, we find evidence for a coherent stream of retrograde stars
encircling the Milky Way from $50-100$ kpc, in the same plane as the

(OB), Red Clump stars (RC), and Main-Sequence-Turn-Off stars (MSTO) with
different average age populations crossed matched with LAMOST DR5 and Gaia DR3.
We reveal the vertical velocities of the three populations varies clearly with
the Galactocentric distance ($R$) and the younger stellar population has
stronger increasing trend in general. The bending and breathing modes indicated
by the vertical motions are dependent on the populations and they are varying
with spatial locations. These vertical motions may be due to the Galactic warp,
or minor mergers, or non-equilibrium of the disk. Assuming the warp is the
dominant component, we find that the warp amplitude ($\gamma$, $Z_\omega$) for
OB (younger population) is larger than that for RC (medium population) and the
later one is also larger than that for MSTO (older population), which is in
agreement with other independent analyses of stellar density distribution, and
supports the warp is long-lived, non-steady structure and has time evolution.
This conclusion is robust whether or not the line-of-nodes $\phi_w$ is fixed or
as a free parameter (with $\phi_w$ is around 3$-$8.5$^{\circ}$ as best fit).
Furthermore, we find that warp is lopsided with asymmetries along azimuthal
angle ($\phi$).

abundances to infer ages may entangle the intrinsic evolution of stars with the
chemodynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a framework
for making probabilistic predictions of stellar ages, and then quantify the
contribution of both stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution to those
predictions using SHAP values. We apply this interpretable prediction framework
to both a simulated Milky Way sample containing stars in a variety of
evolutionary stages and an APOGEE-mocked sample of red clump stars. We find
that in the former case, stellar evolution is the dominant driver for age
estimates, while in the latter case, the more restricted evolutionary
information causes the model to proxy ages through the chemical evolution
model. We show that as a result of the use of non-intrinsic Galactic chemical
information, trends estimated with the predicted ages, such as the
age-metallicity relation, can deviate from the truth.

  Results in M31","8 pages, 4 figures, IAU Symposium 377, Early Disk-Galaxy Formation:
  From JWST to the Milky Way",,,,astro-ph.GA,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We present initial results from our JWST NIRSpec program to study the
$\alpha$-abundances in the M31 disk. The Milky Way has two chemically-defined
disks, the low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ disks, which are closely related to
the thin and thick disks, respectively. The origin of the two populations and
the $\alpha$-bimodality between them is not entirely clear, although there are
now several models that can reproduce the observed features. To help constrain
the models and discern the origin, we have undertaken a study of the chemical
abundances of the M31 disk using JWST NIRSpec, in order to determine whether
stars in M31's disk also show an $\alpha$-abundance bimodality. Approximately
100 stars were observed in our single NIRSpec field at a projected distance of
18 kpc from the M31 center. The 1-D extracted spectra have an average
signal-to-noise ratio of 85 leading to statistical metallicity precision of
0.016 dex, $\alpha$-abundance precision of 0.012 dex, and a radial velocity
precision 8 km/s. The initial results indicate that, in contrast to the Milky
Way, there is no $\alpha$-bimodality in the M31 disk, and no low-$\alpha$
sequence. The entire stellar population falls along a single chemical sequence
very similar to the MW's high-alpha component which had a high star formation
rate. While this is somewhat unexpected, the result is not that surprising
based on other studies that found the M31 disk has a larger velocity dispersion
than the MW and is dominated by a thick component. M31 has had a more active
accretion and merger history than the MW which might explain the chemical
differences.

with Gaussian Process Regression, to identify patterns within elemental
abundance point clouds correlated with various cluster mass functions. Notably,
the WL algorithm exhibits superior interpretability, efficacy and robustness
compared to deep sets and graph convolutional neural networks and enables
optimal training with significantly fewer simulations (O(10)), a reduction of
at least two orders of magnitude relative to graph neural networks.

spectroscopy surveys, necessitating a paradigm shift in spectral fitting
techniques. Our study proposes three enhancements to transcend the limitations
of the current spectral emulation models. We implement an attention-based
emulator, adept at unveiling long-range information between wavelength pixels.
We leverage a domain-specific fine-tuning strategy where the model is
pre-trained on spectra with fixed stellar parameters and variable elemental
abundances, followed by fine-tuning on the entire domain. Moreover, by treating
wavelength as an autonomous model parameter, akin to neural radiance fields,
the model can generate spectra on any wavelength grid. In the case with a
training set of O(1000), our approach exceeds current leading methods by a
factor of 5-10 across all metrics.

of the southern sky trailing the Magellanic Clouds - has been exquisitely
mapped in the five decades since its discovery. However, despite concerted
efforts, no stellar counterpart to the MS has been conclusively identified.
This stellar stream would reveal the distance and 6D kinematics of the MS,
constraining its formation and the past orbital history of the Clouds. We have
been conducting a spectroscopic survey of the most distant and luminous red
giant stars in the Galactic outskirts. From this dataset, we have discovered a
prominent population of 13 stars matching the extreme angular momentum of the
Clouds, spanning up to $100^\circ$ along the MS at distances of $60-120$ kpc.
Furthermore, these kinemetically-selected stars lie along a
[$\alpha$/Fe]-deficient track in chemical space from $-2.5 < \mathrm{[Fe/H]} <
-0.5$, consistent with their formation in the Clouds themselves. We identify
these stars as high-confidence members of the Magellanic Stellar Stream. Half
of these stars are metal-rich and closely follow the gaseous MS, whereas the
other half are more scattered and metal-poor. We argue that the metal-rich
stream is the recently-formed tidal counterpart to the MS, and speculate that
the metal-poor population was thrown out of the SMC outskirts during an earlier
interaction between the Clouds. The Magellanic Stellar Stream provides a strong
set of constraints - distances, 6D kinematics, and birth locations - that will
guide future simulations towards unveiling the detailed history of the Clouds.

Comments welcome",,,,astro-ph.IM astro-ph.CO,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are frequently utilized in astronomy
to construct an emulator of numerical simulations. Nevertheless, training GANs
can prove to be a precarious task, as they are prone to instability and often
lead to mode collapse problems. Conversely, the diffusion model also has the
ability to generate high-quality data without adversarial training. It has
shown superiority over GANs with regard to several natural image datasets. In
this study, we undertake a quantitative comparison between the denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and StyleGAN2 (one of the most robust
types of GANs) via a set of robust summary statistics from scattering
transform. In particular, we utilize both models to generate the images of 21
cm brightness temperature mapping, as a case study, conditionally based on
astrophysical parameters that govern the process of cosmic reionization. Using
our new Fr\'echet Scattering Distance (FSD) as the evaluation metric to
quantitatively compare the sample distribution between generative models and
simulations, we demonstrate that DDPM outperforms StyleGAN2 on varied sizes of
training sets. Through Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that on our datasets,
StyleGAN2 exhibits mode collapses in varied ways, while DDPM yields a more
robust generation. We also explore the role of classifier-free guidance in DDPM
and show the preference for a non-zero guidance scale only when the training
data is limited. Our findings indicate that the diffusion model presents a
promising alternative to GANs in the generation of accurate images. These
images can subsequently provide reliable parameter constraints, particularly in
the realm of astrophysics.
