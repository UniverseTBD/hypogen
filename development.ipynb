       "\"  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are frequently utilized in astronomy\\nto construct an emulator of numerical simulations. Nevertheless, training GANs\\ncan prove to be a precarious task, as they are prone to instability and often\\nlead to mode collapse problems. Conversely, the diffusion model also has the\\nability to generate high-quality data without adversarial training. It has\\nshown superiority over GANs with regard to several natural image datasets. In\\nthis study, we undertake a quantitative comparison between the denoising\\ndiffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and StyleGAN2 (one of the most robust\\ntypes of GANs) via a set of robust summary statistics from scattering\\ntransform. In particular, we utilize both models to generate the images of 21\\ncm brightness temperature mapping, as a case study, conditionally based on\\nastrophysical parameters that govern the process of cosmic reionization. Using\\nour new Fr\\\\'echet Scattering Distance (FSD) as the evaluation metric to\\nquantitatively compare the sample distribution between generative models and\\nsimulations, we demonstrate that DDPM outperforms StyleGAN2 on varied sizes of\\ntraining sets. Through Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that on our datasets,\\nStyleGAN2 exhibits mode collapses in varied ways, while DDPM yields a more\\nrobust generation. We also explore the role of classifier-free guidance in DDPM\\nand show the preference for a non-zero guidance scale only when the training\\ndata is limited. Our findings indicate that the diffusion model presents a\\npromising alternative to GANs in the generation of accurate images. These\\nimages can subsequently provide reliable parameter constraints, particularly in\\nthe realm of astrophysics.\\n\""
