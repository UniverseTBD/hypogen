# HYPOGEN: ADVERSARIAL HYPOTHESIS GENERATION AND STRUCTURED REPRESENTATION FROM SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE
Generating scientific hypotheses with LLMs.

## `preprocessing.py`
`preprocessing.py` serves as the initial pipeline for hypothesis extraction from academic abstracts based on the Bit-Flip concept. Utilising a custom prompt and a fine-tuned language model hosted on Azure, the script takes in research abstracts from ArXiv as input and outputs structured representations of the Bit and Flipâ€”the prevailing belief being challenged and the counterargument, respectively. This data is captured in a JSON-style dictionary and further serialised for easy storage and subsequent analysis. The script is designed to be scalable and employs multi-threading to expedite the processing of large datasets. This enables it to handle batches of abstracts, either by appending to an existing dataset or creating a new one.
